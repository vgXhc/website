There are some efforts underway to no longer allow right turns on red in Madison.
For people walking and biking, right-turning motor vehicles pose a threat, as is demonstrated in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhLZXqmP9fw) of an intersection where I myself recently had a very close call. Other cities in the US, such as Washington (DC) or cambridge (MA) are in the process of eliminating right turns on red.

For our local effort, I offered to help with some crash data analysis. It is difficult to determine how many crashes can be directly attributed to right on red, we can at least answer the question: How many crashes involving people walking and biking occur at signalized intersections?

# Crash data

Crash data is available from [Community Maps](https://transportal.cee.wisc.edu/partners/community-maps/crash/search/BasicSearch.do) the statewide crash data reporting portal.
For registered users, one of the available filters is for "intersection" crashes.
We start by downloading all crashes in the City and Town of Madison that have an intersection flag as well as the bicycle or pedestrian flag.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
library(tmap)
tmap_mode("view")


ped_crashes <- read_csv("data/crash-records.csv")
bike_crashes <- read_csv("data/crash-records(1).csv")
all_crashes <- rbind(ped_crashes, bike_crashes)

all_crashes <- all_crashes |> 
  mutate(bike_ped = case_when(
    PEDFLAG == "Y" ~ "ped",
    BIKEFLAG == "Y" ~ "bike"
  ),
  severity = case_when(
    INJSVR == "K" ~ "Fatality",
    INJSVR == "A" ~ "Serious injury",
    INJSVR == "B" ~ "Minor injury",
    INJSVR == "C" ~ "Possible injury",
    INJSVR == "O" ~ "No injury"
  ),
  severity = factor(severity, 
                    levels = c("Fatality",
                               "Serious injury",
                               "Minor injury",
                               "Possible injury",
                               "No injury"))
  )

```

Mapping the crashes shows that something weird is going on:

```{r}
tm_shape(st_as_sf(all_crashes, coords = c("LONGITUDE", "LATITUDE")))+
  tm_dots()
```

Crashes in the middle of the ocean?
No: Crashes that were not geocoded and therefore have coordinates of 0,0.
I looked up the crash reports for all these and manually added coordinates:

```{r}

# not 100% sure about this one; description kinda confusing

all_crashes_sf <- st_as_sf(all_crashes, coords = c("LONGITUDE", "LATITUDE"))
```

We map again to make sure it looks good:

```{r}
tmap_mode("plot")
tm_shape(all_crashes_sf) +
  tm_dots("bike_ped", size = 1)

```

# Signalized intersections

The City's open data portal has [intersection controls for all intersections in the county](https://data-cityofmadison.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/cityofmadison::intersection-control/).
Signalized intersections are coded `SL`.

```{r}

intersection_control <- st_read("data/Intersection_Control.geojson")

signals <- intersection_control |> 
  filter(IntControl == "SL")
```

Now we create a 50-meter buffer[^1] around the signal locations and only keep crashes within that buffer:

[^1]: 50 meters is based on some trial and error with different buffer sizes.
    Too small and you risk undercounting (e.g. crashes at large intersections); too big a buffer, and you may attribute crashes at a nearby unsignalized intersection to the signalized one.

```{r}

st_crs(all_crashes_sf) <- 4326


crashes_at_signals <- all_crashes_sf[st_within(all_crashes_sf, st_buffer(signals, dist = 50)) %>% lengths > 0,]

```

Now we can map all crashes at signalized intersections, separated into bike and bike crashes:

## Bike crashes at signalized intersections

```{r layout="l-body-outset", preview=TRUE}
popup_vars <- c("DOCTNMBR", "bike_ped", "severity", "ACCDDATE","ACCDHOUR","ONRDWY","ONRDWYDIR","ATRDWY","INTDIS","INTDIR","TOTFATL","TOTINJ","TOTVEH","MNRCOLL","ACCDTYPE","AGGRFLAG","BUSFLAG","CMVFLAG","CONSZONE","DISTRCTD","IMPAIRED","INTRFLAG","LANEDP1U","LANEDP2U","SPEEDFLAG","TEENDRVR","65+DRVR")

tmap_mode("view")
tm_shape(crashes_at_signals |> filter(bike_ped == "bike")) +
  tm_dots("severity",
          popup.vars = popup_vars) +
  tm_layout(main.title = "Bike intersection crashes")
```
## Ped crashes at signalized intersections
```{r layout="l-body-outset"}
tm_shape(crashes_at_signals |> filter(bike_ped == "ped")) +
  tm_dots("severity",
          popup.vars = popup_vars) +
  tm_layout(main.title = "Pedestrian intersection crashes")
```

Some summary statistics.
Overall, there were `r nrow(all_crashes)` intersection crashes involving people walking and biking between January 2012 and now.
Out of those, `r nrow(crashes_at_signals)` (`r round(nrow(crashes_at_signals)/nrow(all_crashes)*100, 0)`%) happened at signalized intersections. These are the numbers of all intersection crashes, grouped by ped/bike and injury severity:

```{r}
all_crashes |> 
  group_by(bike_ped, severity) |> 
  tally() |> 
  gt::gt()
```

And here are the ones at signalized intersections only:

```{r}
crashes_at_signals |> 
  st_drop_geometry() |> 
  group_by(bike_ped, severity) |> 
  tally() |> 
  gt::gt()
```
