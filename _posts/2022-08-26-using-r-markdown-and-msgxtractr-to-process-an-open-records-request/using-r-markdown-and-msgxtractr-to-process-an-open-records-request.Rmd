A friend recently asked for assistance with data she received from an open records request.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true">

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">

emotionally I was not prepared for WISDOT to send me a Box folder filled with documents that I can't figure out how to download in response to my obnoxious open records request from \~6 months ago

The data she received consisted of a zip file with 70-something `*.msg` files.
This is a proprietary Microsoft file format used by Outlook for storing emails.
I quickly checked if there was an R package for handling the data, and indeed there is: [`msgextractor`](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/msgxtractr).
With this package and some R and RMarkdown I figured converting the files to something more convenient would not be too difficult.

In the end it took me much longer than I had hoped, but it works.
The process has two pieces: An `R` script with a function to read in a single email, extract some information, and save the email's attachments in a separate folder.
The second piece: A RMarkdown `.Rmd` template that uses variables generated in the function to create an `HTML` file with email metadata, the body, and links to the attachments.
The `R` then script then iterates the function over the list of `*.msg` files with the `walk` function from the [{purr}](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/) package.
This creates one `HTML` file for each of the emails.

Here's the R script:

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(msgxtractr) #install with devtools::install_github("hrbrmstr/msgxtractr") 
library(tidyverse)
library(here)

# read list of msg files in folders
files <- list.files("data/All Files/")

# extract and save attachments and return paths
write_msg_files <- function(msg_file){
  msg <- read_msg(paste0("data/All Files/", msg_file))
  dir_name <- paste0("output/", msg_file)
  dir.create(dir_name)
  save_attachments(msg_obj = msg, path = dir_name)
  #return path and file names for attachments
  attachment_names <- list.files(dir_name)
  attachment_paths <- paste0(msg_file, "/", attachment_names)
  # contents for output documents
  email <- data_frame(email = msg_file,
                   from = unlist(msg$headers$From),
                   to = unlist(msg$headers$To),
                   cc = unlist(msg$headers$CC),
                   subject = unlist(msg$headers$Subject),
                   date = unlist(msg$headers$Date),
                   body = paste(msg$body$text, collapse = "\n"),
                   attachments = list(attachment_paths))
  
  #render output document
  rmarkdown::render(
    input = "output_template.Rmd",
    output_file = here("output", paste0(msg_file, ".html"))
  )
}


# iterate over list of files
walk(files, write_attachments)
```

And this is what the output template looks like:

````{verbatim, lang = "markdown"}
    ---
    output: html_document
    ---

    ```{r setup, include=FALSE}
    knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = F)
```

    ```{r}
    library(msgxtractr)
    library(tidyverse)
    ```
    # `r email[1,]$email`

    **From:** `r email[1,]$from`

    **To:** `r email$to`

    **CC:** `r email$cc`

    **Date:** `r email$date`

    **Subject:** `r email$subject`


    ```{r results='asis'}
    cat(email[1,]$body)
    ```

    ## Attachments
    ```{r results='asis'}
    #creates markdown links to attachments
    map_chr(email$attachments[[1]], ~paste0("[", ., "](", ., ")"))
    ```
````

This works nicely, with one exception: There were two `msg` files whose content was *another* `msg` file as an attachment (which in turn had attachments).
`msgxtractor` currently [can't deal with these](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/msgxtractr/issues/13) and so I had to remove them from the dataset.

Here's what the output looks like:
