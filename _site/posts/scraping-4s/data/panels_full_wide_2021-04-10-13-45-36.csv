(Bio)Engineering Nature: Editing environments through biotechnology,"Elliott Reichardt, Stanford University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Posted: January 27, 2021
","
				
				
				Since the discovery in 2015 of the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system, research into its applications for has exploded. The use of CRISPR/Cas9 and related technologies has enabled scientists to edit the genomes of organisms with an unparalleled level of accuracy and specificity making feasible the genomic editing of environments and ecosystems. Scientists have pointed out that the new technologies like “gene drives”, which nearly guarantee the inheritance of targeted genes, could be used for admirable public health goals such as transforming or suppressing harmful populations of malaria transmitting mosquitoes or schistosomiasis-carrying snails. Environmentalists have similarly suggested that gene drives be used to suppress populations of harmful or invasive species, such as lionfish. Theoretically, these technologies appear remarkably promising. Yet important questions regarding their regulation, usage and development remain underexplored. This panel solicits submissions from groups or individuals of any background interested in developing a rich conversation regarding historical and ongoing attempts to molecularly edit environments with an emphasis on gene drive technologies. Ideally, presenters would explore gene drives in all their complexity, from their social and economic context to their political and environmental implications. This panel would especially welcome papers that document scientific and regulatory processes through which these technologies must go through with a careful attention to empirical detail.

				STS scholarship on technopolitics typically examines the role that governments and state organizations play in producing, enabling, and leveraging data, technology, and science. Technocratic projects like conducting censuses, modeling weather, producing medicines, constructing computers or developing weapons serve both state and scientific masters. While the legitimacy of these investments are often intertwined with the legitimacy of state power, such power — and legitimacy — also relies upon scientific development and the sustained production of technoscientific imaginaries. 
Yet recent years have witnessed a range of governmental actions around the world designed to purposefully delegitimize states’ technoscientific investments. Politicians work to dismantle state-funded scientific efforts, often under the guise of free-market commitments and austerity principles. The Covid-19 pandemic has revealed the global cost of distrust in public-sector science, technology, and data. Even as scientists produced a vaccine with unprecedented speed, governments around the world failed to track the spread of the virus, let alone provide data to enable decision-making. In some countries, political leaders are propagated conspiracies and “fake science”, undermining public health and scientific development. 
Just as governments can help advance science, technology, and data, they may also choose to strategically curb such pursuits — or actively undermine their legitimacy.
This panel examines how public-sector technoscientific efforts are made legitimate, and how that legitimacy is strategically undermined. We ask, how are state-sponsored science and technology projects legitimated? How can this legitimacy come undone? How can trust in public-sector technoscience be repaired?

				The deepening datafication of urban life has had profound impacts on the organization, exploitation, and circulation of natural, social, economic, and political resources. These impacts are often material—for example in the extraction of minerals required to build digital devices or in the siting of data centers—and often discursive—as digitization becomes a rationale and logic guiding urbanization and new forms of data colonialism. What underlies them all is a unique set of circulations, movement, flows, and streams.
In particular, streams of data make the circulations visible and governable. The datafication of urban services (e.g., energy, transportation, water, and waste) allows for real-time, fine-grained identification, quantification, and spatialization of all sorts of flows running across urban space. This key idea behind “smart city” discourses promises more control over urban space, urban metabolism, and streams of privately-held revenue.
This panel explores how data capture, channel, and tame streams, circulation, and flows across urban space. We are especially (but not exclusively) interested in empirical and theoretical contributions from the Global South, and studies attuned to human and non-human relations.
Questions
How has datafication, and the processes necessitating, facilitating, and emanating from it, transformed the ecologies and resources subtending urban space and urbanization?
How are flows initiated, maintained, and terminated for particular political and economic interests?
How do digital and analog urban infrastructures slow, accelerate, or direct these flows?
What sorts of knowledges and epistemologies are possible within this milieu, and how can we politicize them?",3,Datafication, circulation, urban studies, capitalism, political ecology,NA,NA,NA,Data and quantification,Infrastructure,Other
(Re)configuring care practices in pandemic times,"Stefan Nicolae, University of Trier","Cristina Popescu, EHESS - Centre d'Etude des Mouvements Sociaux",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Posted: January 27, 2021
","
				
				
				Care practices were addressed in STS by Annemarie Mol (2002, 2008, 2010) as capturing a specific way of engaging with material reality as well as framing situated human relations. Hence, care bears not only upon intimacy or affectivity, but relates to forms of interdependency between ontology and normativity (“ontonorms”; Mol 2012).
The open panel starts from and further develops the discussions on relevance of care practices focussing on the (re)configurations of care practices during the COVID-19 pandemic. Such a discussion of „care“ takes up not only a currently highly relevant social topic, but also acknowledges the salient empirical shaping of theoretical reflections on care in STS as ways of handling reality and transforming social relations. 
While COVID-19 differently addresses virologists, clinicians, physicists, epidemiologists, immunologists, or economics (Mol and Hardon 2020), a wide range of practices of care proliferated in response to the health crisis beyond these formal and mainstream settings, draw mainly on spatial (and social) proximity (neighbourhoods, peer-groups), and emphasised a temporal continuity of the caring engagement (regular visits, extended homeschooling). In a word: specific (re)configurations of care are rendered visible in dealing with personal concern, vulnerability, and (inter)dependence (Kittay 2015). 
The panel welcomes contributions on topics as:
– expertise negotiated along care practices;
– care related to groups traditionally framed as disadvantaged: elderly, people with disabilities, indigenous people, and other culturally diverse groups;
– goods shaping actors understanding of care;
– alliances of human and non-human entities as modes of pragmatic coping with pandemic crisis;
– methodological adjustments regarding (re)configurations of care. ",4,practices of care, ontology, normativity, vulnerability, interdependence, elderly, disability, cultural diversity,Method and Practice,Social Justice/Social Movement,Other
"(Re)materialising Cancer: Bodies, Cells and Environments","Emily Ross, The University of Sheffield","Julia Swallow, University of Edinburgh",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Posted: January 27, 2021
","
				
				
				Bioscientific approaches to identifying, classifying and diagnosing cancer have long enrolled practices that engage with the materiality of tumour tissues and cells, such as cytology and histology. In the contemporary era, scientific techniques detect and act upon cancer outwith tumour tissue itself. For example, pre-cells, inflammatory cells, immune system T cells and microbes are becoming understood to play a role in cancer. Molecular pathology has also allowed for exploration of the makeup of cancerous tissues as inscribed within genetic code, and can ‘diagnose’ predispositions to cancer. Such techniques, along with designations of cells as ‘pre-cancerous’, add a temporal dimension to the materiality of cancer. These approaches locate cancer within structures and organisms beyond the tangibility of tumour tissue, and demonstrate that various elements of bodies and their environments continuously interact to constitute the disease.
Contemporary scientific work thus generates a picture of cancer as more than malignant, fleshy tumours, with the disease materialising in genes, healthy cells, and wider (bodily) environments. This refigures the material constitution of cancer, blurs clinical categorisations of tissues and cells as malignant or benign, and prompts us to think about cancer in ways that unsettle widespread ‘fixed’ sociocultural understandings of the disease. In this session we will discuss configurations of cancer that disrupt understandings of the disease as manifested in a malignant, fleshy, tumour. We ask ‘what constitutes cancer?’ and address the implications of these diverse configurations for scientific and clinical practice, embodied experiences, patient subjectivities, and sociocultural depictions of cancer.

				In recent years, an increasing amount of STS and STS-aligned scholarship has used provocative and conceptually creative ways to address the exceptional challenges posed by global climate change. A number of theoretical orientations have emerged within the field of Anthropocene studies, such as new materialism and Gaia-based approaches, offering sophisticated ways for scholars to think through the implications of climate change for both human and more-than-human life. However, these shifts have also inspired backlash from those who argue that the constant search for new theory obfuscates empirical realities and the politics of responsibility (Malm 2018). Particularly in light of the climate crisis, the at-times tenuous and overlapping relationships between theoretical creativity, empirical rigor, and everyday action demand renewed critical attention.
This panel seeks to critically engage these fragile relationships within Anthropocene STS scholarship to illuminate potentials for individual, academic, and political meaning in a warming world. How can scholars hold onto both climate realism and creative conceptualizations of more-than-humans? Does the urgency of global warming demand a more overt level of political engagement in academia? Can we effectively reconcile the conceptual utility of our theoretical methodologies with the pragmatic and embodied risks of ecological justice? We welcome papers which might address these multiscalar gaps, reframing potential discrepancies as constructive spaces of possibility for good relations between fellow earthlings.",6,climate, ecological justice, Anthropocene,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Environmental/Multispecies Studies,NA,NA

				Over the last 70 years, computational and networked media have become deeply integrated with higher education and have slowly adopted and integrated various technologies. The newest generation of technologies engaging higher education centers around what is popularly called artificial intelligence, otherwise known as machine learning.  Machine learning creates models that, in part self-design solutions that may include interaction, prediction, and other simulatable aspects.  This panel invites papers that engage with questions of academic automation, machine un/learning, and artificial non/intelligence in the academic context.  It seeks critical papers that examine questions around  automatic grading, artificial teaching assistants, robotic instructors, other academic technologies, and the transformation of the student and professor roles concerning these technologies.  
This panel also seeks papers that engage these technologies in other academic roles, such as research or service as work.  How are these technologies mediating different academic functions? Who benefits from these technologies? And who is privileged by them?
We have to consider the roles of craft, artistry, and humanity in those roles.  Is there an argument to be made for automation in the academy? Is there an argument to be made for AI/Machine learning in the academy?  What kind of relations do these establish?  Following Ivan Illich, should we be rethinking our relations to develop tools and systems that treat us as human, perhaps even more human than our current system? Following Virilio, what will be their accident?  What are the good relations between our academic institutions, their people, and these new technologies?

				“Objects, processes, or events that in some ways disclose, generate, or intensify the condition of being enveloped by the elemental force of atmospheres,” Derek McCormack (2018) proposes, are “atmospheric things.” The balloon, for instance, might be construed as a device that not only explicates but also draws force from its immersion in air. We invite papers that contend with aerotechnologies, understood as infrastructures, devices, knowledge systems, and particles that make air as much a technological fact as it is a natural one. What does it mean to study air as elemental technology? How is air — as an element — constitutive, pervasive, and facilitative of emergent kinds of social experiences and relations? How are wind (Howe 2019, Boyer 2019), climate engineering (Furuhata 2019), teargas (Nieuwenhuis 2016), industrial gases (Banken and Stokes 2015), terrariums (Darby 2007), breathing (Braun 2014; Mbembe 2020), as well as other airy matters technologically mediated, rendered, and configured? How does air come to be known or contested through processes of racial, (settler) colonial, and capitalist formations (Flikke 2018, Simmons 2017)? If techne denotes the practices of making, we propose that aerotechnologies relate and relay connections between people, non-human actors, epochs, and places, evoking the conference theme that asks what are good (airy) relations? In addition to treating air as technological, we are also interested in papers that explore air as an elemental medium that link different scales of political and social action (Peters 2015, Horn 2018, Choy 2011), especially from perspectives tethered in the global South.

				In recent years, Science and Technology studies have paid increasing attention to ageing and elderly care. At the cross-road with critical age studies, new areas and theoretical developments such as socio-gerontechnology or material gerontology are making important contributions. Informed by material-semiotics, post-humanism, and affect theory these developments are shedding light on the critical role of materiality and other-than-human beings in the constitution of old age as a social construct and bio-political device. They show how notions of ageing well (such as active ageing or successful ageing) are materialised in technological and biomedical innovations and how these configure modes of doing age in older’s people daily-life. Drawing on the more-than-human turn in STS and age studies, this panel is an invitation to extend the reach of these developments beyond their traditional focus on innovative digital and biomedical “solutions” for the ageing society. We invite papers that consider more-than-human entanglements with animal, plants, buildings, landscapes, etc. in critical studies of age and elderly care. We also look for contributions that delve into the politics of relations in these more-than-human entanglements in later life. The panel is an invitation to consider questions such as: How elderly care is reconfigured when care is not considered from anthropocentric visions? What does ageing and old age become when ageing is seen as a stage of becoming-with other-than-humans? How do other-than-human ageing and elderly care matter in these entanglements? What notions of ageing well and good elderly care emerge as a result of this?

				Much excellent work has documented how contemporary artificial intelligence (AI) systems reinforce and deepen historical inequalities and oppressions. Further work remains, however, on whether and how AI systems can do otherwise. Recent social movements within AI research have begun to politicize AI technologies and their entanglements with social justice, power relations, and environmentalism (see, for example, #TechWontBuiltIt and recent ACM special issues on “AI Activism” and “Green AI”). In a current technology ecosystem dominated by commercial and military interests, however, few possibilities seem to exist for AI practitioners to “strive towards good relations” among humans, technologies, and environments. 
This panel seeks to investigate how theories, methods, and ways of knowing from decades of feminist STS scholarship can inform the study of AI systems as they are used today. In Alison Adam’s (1995) feminist critique of AI epistemology, she emphasizes the need for more concrete examples of a “successor science” based on feminist epistemology and social constructivism to ground AI research. What would “successor AI” look like, built on feminist principles of situated knowledges and standpoint theory? Beyond universalized, depoliticized notions of “ethical AI,” might an analysis using feminist STS ground AI systems in complex sociotechnical entanglements and particular histories, geographies, communities, and contexts?
This panel invites work that engages with these questions and imagines new possibilities for feminist AI technologies. Topics can include, but are not limited to, the following:
* Social and political movements that aim to centre ethics of care, entanglement, relationality, and responsibility in human-AI systems
* Indigenous, Black, feminist, and queer conceptualizations of “artificial intelligence”
* Disability studies, feminist STS, and artificial intelligence
* Ecofeminism, environmental justice, “green AI” and environmental impacts of AI systems
* Standpoint theory and the politics of image, speech, and emotion recognition systems
* Intersections and contradictions between feminist health projects and AI in healthcare
* New methods and imagined futures for feminist, de-/anti-colonial, anti-military, anti-carceral, anti-capitalist AI ",10,feminist STS, artificial intelligence, technofeminism, feminist technologies, ethical AI,NA,NA,NA,"Big Data, AI and Machine Learning",Feminist STS / Queer STS,"Information, Computing and Media Technology"

				The Exquisite Corpse (Le Cadavre exquis, https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-explaining-exquisite-corpse-surrealist-drawing-game-die) is a collaborative game of imperfect assemblage: each participant adds to a composition in sequence, not knowing or knowing little of what was added beforehand. In this panel, we deploy the “exquisite corpse” as a method and provocation for survival, collaboration, and playful relations during these uncertain times, investing not in fixed outcomes but emergent relationships and knowledges.
We invite anyone interested in an imaginative and experimental exercise, and in forging a liminal space of collaboration and solidarity, to join us in collectively creating an exquisite corpse. Individual submissions should not be traditional conference presentations but stories, poems, visualizations, or  other narrative forms that center around research spaces unsettled by disturbances, quakes, fires, waters, or human catastrophe; timelines, career trajectories, research plans, budgets or any project plan disrupted in the face of trauma and uncertainty; relationships and bodies broken, brittle, and precarious. The only condition is that you leave your contribution open to articulation, re-pair, and imaginative attachments that can ferment unsuspected forms of sense-making, relationship-building, knowledge-production, and negotiation. Collectively, we will then assemble and draw connections that create multiple possibilities and outcomes for a more careful academic practice. Through the configuration of this exquisite corpse, we will explore the folds, redirections, and emergent properties that can generate good relations within the university and beyond.
We welcome fellow scholars from all disciplines, fields, and places of research to help us create and imagine re-paired relations within and outside of the university.

Simultaneously, the deployment of AI, AI-based robots and smart information systems takes place in a context of global inequalities and competition, as well as well differences in cultural values, political systems and scientific capacities. 
In this panel we welcome contributions that explore aspects of the following questions:

(ii) Which region-specific and shared global challenges emerge with regard to the governance of AI, AI-based robots and smart information systems?
(iii) What are the effects of AI technologies on issues related to equality, diversity, justice  and inclusion/exclusion around the world?
(iv) What are the implications of the global adoption and use of AI systems for STS, and the ways in which relations between humans, data, intelligent machines and the (social and natural) environment are conceptualised and governed?
The panel invites conceptual, theoretical and empirical contributions from across the world, with a particular interest in perspectives from Africa, Asia, the Middle East, Central and South America as we well Oceania.

				In recent decades there has been an enduring call for STS research to offer practical value for those we study (Downey and Zuiderent-Jerak, 2017). This focus on societal impact raises questions about the value of knowledge production. Yet, it also produces new affordances to empower marginalized subjects and do good for society at large.   
STS has a rich history in interventionist research, building on calls to ‘move beyond criticism’ and actively influence the worlds we research for the better (Timmermans and Berg, 2003). Under the umbrella of ‘applied research’, distinct epistemological regimes and ‘sorting attachments’ (Jensen, 2007) of research reveal an increasing pressure to demonstrate immediate value. Such calls for practical value of social science have developed within a larger neoliberal trend, in which the university is increasingly reliant on external revenue and as a research and educational institute is governed by a logic of accountability and measurable outputs. The implications of this move towards practical relevance for scientific practice and its produced epistemologies have been well-documented for the natural and life sciences. However, far less attention has been given to the epistemological implications of interventionalist research for the social sciences. 
In this panel we encourage scholars to explore and theorize the increasing demand for applied approaches in social science research and how it impacts STS aims of interventionist research and knowledge production. We ask: what are the consequences of interventionist research for the epistemologies produced by STS scholars and what ‘modes of doing good’ does it produce?

How should a self-driving car decide who to kill in the event of a crash? What are the existential risks of superintelligence? Tech billionaires like discussing these things precisely because they sidestep the real politics of AI.
STS suggests a very different set of questions that switch attention to the attachments of innovation rather than its autonomy: Given that AI will not be as independent as its proponents suggest, under what conditions could it benefit particular groups?

				There’s something in the water. Mosquitos swimming in still puddles, oil floating in the ocean, ice rock shoring in lunar poles. Carbon sinking into hydrogen and oxygen. A tea bag diffusing into a boiling kettle.
Water is not just water, a distinct category with fixed boundaries. In these examples/moments water is encountering something, becoming caught up in a process of perturbing, transforming, evoking. This panel asks you to attend to this becoming with. We encourage papers that step away from modes of analysis which stabilize water as well as the expectant definitions and categories of water. Rather, lean into water’s mutability. What emerges when we bring water’s capacity to affect and become affected into focus in our ethnographies? What methodologies stem from observing, recording, articulating the process of water co-evolving with the human, nonhuman, nonlife entities it encounters? How can the micro-moments in which water becomes an altering, entangling, disrupting entity shape analytical currents in our fields? We invite papers that take a speculative or experimental approach to water by focusing on moments when it is saturated with potential to commingle, or already participating in transmutations and reconfigurations. 
Water is an entity, a force, and an environmental context that catalyzes and sustains multi-scalar relations across and beyond earth. As colonial, capitalist, and climatic processes bring human relations with water into focus, this panel probes water as a site for enriching analytical, metaphorical, and methodological approaches to the ethical, the ecological, the technoscientific, and the political in a shifting world.

				Critical STS scholars have exposed “lab life” as a key arena of agentive relations and as sites of more than technical assemblages (Clark and Fujimura 1992, Traweek 1998). Social scientists have also found the form of “a lab” generative for organizing collaborations and essential to gaining institutional recognition and funding. We seek to move beyond the important work of first generation lab studies that demonstrated the political nature of (bench and social) science to place the studying of labs alongside the establishment of qualitative STS labs– ones that draw on traditional laboratory models yet incorporate alternative frameworks of inclusion and non-extractive epistemologies. Our focus is this dual nature of labs as systems of relations. 
Extending Roy’s (2018) incitement for feminist laboratory methods into the work of qualitative labs, we ask two central questions: what makes a qualitative lab a lab, and what are its methods of good relations? Following Liboiron et al. (2017), how do labs relate to, or materialize in, particular methodologies, ethnographic productions and collaborations?
Submissions might address the above through consideration of:
*Alternatives to Latourian-style laboratory studies
*Ethics and praxis of collaborative networks among and between labs, the public and private sectors
*Methodological strategies for analyzing lab collaborations and participating in them
*The role of labs as workplaces and as places of often precarious employment
*Models for building labs, their intersection with other kinds of institutional relations, and especially for those outside R1 institutions,
*The heightened stakes of these conditions in and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic ",17,laboratory models, feminist STS, collaborative relations, ethics,NA,NA,NA,NA,Feminist STS / Queer STS,Method and Practice,NA

				Critical feminist STS has constructively challenged the cisheteronormativity and white supremacy embedded in an array of sciences, from animal behavior to toxicology to urban ecology (Visperas, Brown, and Sexton 2016; Cipolla, Gupta, and Rubin 2017; Hoover 2017). This panel builds from these critiques to highlight emerging shifts—despite ongoing obstacles—within contemporary scientific methods and practices, focusing on field sites and laboratory spaces. We recognize that even those practitioners committed to queering and decolonizing scientific knowledge production face entrenched systems of hierarchy and linearity. And yet, we also sense fantastic(al) potential. For instance, what pathways to environmental justice do queer, Black feminist, and Indigenous studies perspectives enable us to see, feel, and traverse? Or, focusing on the embodied experience of doing work in the field/lab in a specific body, what dangers and risks does this work entail? What would making space for BIPOC, queer, and trans scientists to do this work make possible, in terms of scientific outcomes, community engagement, and environmental justice action? We are especially interested in how queer and trans perspectives on cisheteronormativity might intersect with Indigenous studies, Black feminist, and political ecology analyses of private property and public lands. For example, how can field science work within tribal protocols to disrupt settler science’s longstanding practice of contributing to dispossession (through creation of conservation areas and parks, advancement of forestry and agriculture, river damming, etc.)? What critical modes of attention does Black feminist biopolitics bring to the study of toxins and/or ecological “purity,” across both urban and rural landscapes?

				Social scientific scholarship on agriculture often focuses on food systems, but this panel addresses dimensions of agricultural production and practice beyond food itself. As pig bodies yield both pork and pharmaceutical materials, corn both animal feed and ethanol, and cannabis both medicine and building materials, how does the practice, governance, and commercialization of agriculture beyond food generate opportunities or challenges for emancipatory change and good relations? Well-studied food system concerns like soil and environmental degradation, violent labor practices, and the plantation logics of industrialism, might be augmented by studies that approach agriculture from non-food perspectives; submissions could address the complexities of agricultural production of medicines/pharmaceuticals, textiles, lumber, or other goods. How and in what ways do these forms of agricultural production generate specific relations with environments, social worlds, scales, industries, or practices of extraction? How can critical or ethnographic studies of agriculture shed light on linked or dependent industries such as pharma or construction? How is racial capitalism working in agriculture beyond and adjacent to food? What are the political potentials or projects surfacing in these forms of agricultural production (for example, climate and and environmental justice), and with what stakes, tactics, demands, or effects?
We invite papers that address a broad range of topics and places. They might present ethnographic work, notes from the field, or historical examinations of specific crops, farms, or industries. We anticipate convening a standard 5- or 6-person panel to meet digitally, though could expand depending on submission numbers.

				We propose a post-solutionist reflection on what is Responsible AI, to discuss interdisciplinary perspectives that contribute to making AI systems more fair, transparent, and inclusive. Solutionism is “recasting all complex social situations either as neat problems with definite, computable solutions or as transparent and self-evident processes that can be easily optimized if only the right algorithms are in place!” (Morozov 2013)
Ethical problems in AI/ML have been exposed through numerous and influential publications (Buolamwini & Gebru 2018, Challen & al 2019, Parikh & al 2019, Yapo & Weiss 2018). How can we move from a view of ethics and responsibility narrowly focused on technical definitions of bias, discrimination, and fairness in AI systems to one which considers interconnecting issues of cognitive bias, social inequality, white supremacy, intersectionality, geopolitical and economic divides?
A robust consideration of ethics and responsibility requires that we interrogate how technologies are interwoven with our social structures, histories, and moral imaginations (Noble 2018; Benjamin 2019). We must go beyond tech solutionism to frame problems without automatically assuming AI/ML is the best or inevitable course of action, to fully explore fine-grain signals and our complete range of options, which can include “do nothing.”
Topics to be addressed include power and ubiquity of automated systems in daily life, over-trust in technical solutions, and whether our current production methodologies and research approaches support or hinder just and equitable AI systems.

				Biometric practices have moved around the world through colonial and postcolonial contexts, transnational exchange, and private sector developments. They have become central to a variety of public and private infrastructures. Often, biometric technologies and data are not built from scratch, rather they are reformulated and repurposed to fit new times, places, and contexts. Automated face and fingerprint identification on smartphones, and biometric data in ID cards, are underwritten by similar methods of body measurement developed by 19th and 20th century eugenics, anthropology, statistics, and criminology researchers. States have appropriated biometric databases as digital platforms, which often serve as foundations upon which other infrastructures are organized. Biometric systems have been used, and reused, for purposes ranging from the delivery of government services to policing, from tracking refugees to COVID-19 mitigation efforts.
This open track invites submissions that address the movement of biometric practices, and their social consequences. Panelists will explore not only how biometric techniques constitute emerging forms of identity governance, but also how they move across time and place, reorganize existing practices, and produce new kinds of infrastructures. Even in new contexts, biometric systems carry the biases and intentions of prior ones. These systems can fail, and present asymmetrical benefits and harms that reinforce inequalities related to race, gender, class, age, and disability. These systems also shape the lived experiences of citizenship, migration, surveillance, and access to services. This panel welcomes papers that leverage STS concepts and methods to probe the trajectories, implementations, and implications of biometrics on the move.

				Machines are central artifacts in the study of science and technology. As both the products and producers of ways of being, machines play an important role in the making and unmaking of lifeworlds. The borderlands needs to be thought of as a machine and a site of machines. The development of converging technologies that make computing power possible is often described in frontier language. Silicon Valley and its network of engineers, technicians, and companies take on the roles of pioneers demarcating new territory for others to inhabit. This territory is positioned as a zone of encounters between various forces, a space from where human creativity takes flight and that is slowly populated by natives who produce new ways of thinking and of being. The language of frontiers, pioneers, and natives in technoscience brings into consideration imperial formations, that is practices, concepts, and bodies that produce ambiguous rules and spaces of inclusion/exclusion. 
This panel brings together concepts and ways of tracing relations from the fields of Feminist STS, Latina/o Studies, and Critical Ethnic Studies to think about technoscience and the borderlands in the making of unequal and uncertain worlds. We invite papers from a range of contexts about:
– Comparative racial formations & technical infrastructures
– Black, Indigenous, and People of Color as critical actors in technoscience
– Technoscience in the/as a borderlands
– Concepts emerging from “border thinkers” as ways to bridge social and technical domains

				Knowledge production in interaction among different actors –be it specific contributions, sustained collaborations or co-productions- is becoming an integral part of academic practices. These trends are reflected in a rich literature within STS studies and other fields of knowledge such as feminist epistemologies seeking to systematize and analyze how these processes develop, what actors participate, what types of questions and problems are addressed, what methods are put in practice and what results emerge.
The systematic recognition of these processes, on the basis of normative concepts, favors the construction of analytical tools as well as conceptual and methodological enrichment. In turn, they reveal the asymmetrical power dynamics, shaping interaction processes. There lies our interest to investigate the relationships established between different actors, the type of problems they address and the way in which different knowledge and practices – experiential and scientific – are recognized and integrated. This panel seeks to analyze the transformations in practices and methods -in different regions of the world- that configure a new heuristic.
How are practices and methods transformed throughout processes of knowledge production in interaction?
How are the relationships between the various actors and knowledge reconfigured? What are the places of non-academic actors in the processes of knowledge production? How do these processes advance in the generation of symmetrical relationships between actors and their knowledge?

				Science is an increasingly global activity. Due to the globalization of the scientific labor market, many countries are implementing policies promoting scientific collaboration and mobility as a means to “internationalize” their scientific system. It has been argued that international and disciplinary collaboration fosters high-quality knowledge production and is necessary to solve complex scientific problems. Collaboration for mutual benefit has also gained increasing acceptance, with “partner” selection becoming a strategic priority to enhance one’s own production. Collaborative partnerships have been shown to be a product of self-organizing networks, in which co-authorships are determined through preferential attachment to high impact and highly visible authors. Collaboration is also influenced by socio-political factors, such as relative size; geographical, historical, linguistic, and thematic proximity; and other socio-economic characteristics.
Intimately related with collaboration is the phenomenon of mobility. Mobility has been advocated as key to increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of research and nations that welcome international researchers and encourage cross-border collaboration tend to produce papers with higher scientific impact. Most analyses focus on the economic and development impact caused by mobility, while a limited few have utilized bibliometric approaches to study scientific mobility at a large-scale and differences between scientific networks created through collaboration and mobility.
We look for studies identifying the convergence or discrepancy of countries in mobility and collaboration patterns, and to determine the relative positions and influence of countries in both processes for improving our understanding of the relationship between scientific mobility and collaboration within the context of scientific and economic capacities.

				An obsession with “scaling up” has captured contemporary innovation discourses and, with it, political and economic life. Perhaps most visible in the rise of big tech, big data, and venture capitalism, scalability thinking has also permeated public policy in the search for transformative solutions to “grand societal challenges,” calls for “entrepreneurial statehood”, or scalable experimental interventions in “living labs” and “evidence-based policy-making.” 
This panel aims to interrogate scalability as a paradigm and ordering logic in the era of big tech. We seek to explore how actors mobilize, stabilize, and exploit notions of scalability in discourses, instruments, and practices. The panel invites empirical and conceptual contributions exploring how the current preoccupation with scalability reconfigures political and economic power, e.g. by invading problem diagnoses as well as normative understandings of how society functions and who authorizes social change, and what kind of frictions it begets. We also welcome critical perspectives on how STS’s engaged program can come to terms with the “politics of scaling” as a powerful corollary of the “politics of technology” that might require new tools and interventions. The panel hopes to stimulate cross-conversations between STS, anthropology, geography, political economy and other fields concerned with a critical analysis of scalability thinking.

				This session explores the multitude of ways that colonial, settler science in Canada masquerades as democratic, and how some Indigenous and non-Indigenous actors are unsettling what counts as ‘Canadian’ science. Technoscientific institutions and practices are a primary modality through which the settler colonial state inflicts violence, and this violence is enacted both materially and epistemically. We suggest that technoscientific practice—be it microbiology, genomics, demography, fisheries, mining, forestry, or data science and AI—continues to do the work of the contemporary colonial state in Canada by reinforcing colonial hierarchies and exclusion, legitimating capitalist extraction, propping up liberal ideas of multiculturalism and diversity, and enabling cultural genocide. This panel also addresses Canadian scientific and innovation infrastructure—tri-council funding agencies and academic and federal science—to consider how funding and research structures enable the ongoing exclusion and marginalization of Indigenous knowledges and practices. 
We invite contributions from scholars exploring a range of technoscientific practices, actors, and areas of expertise in the Canadian context to examine the national politics of transnational technoscience in the settler state. How has settler science worked to delegitimize Indigenous-led projects? How can we remake technoscientific methods in order to move toward caring, good relations? We seek papers that offer empirically grounded analyses of the relations and material practices that make up settler science. By examining the ways in which Canadian technoscience might be unsettled and decolonized, we aim to facilitate urgently-needed conversations in STS on the possibilities for challenging the persistent colonial work of Canadian scientific projects.

				Current changes in cannabis regulatory policies, fueled by the debate over its medical use, spell out a political engagement allied with an epistemic work of producing knowledge about this plant and its properties in order to challenge prohibitionist regulation and (re-)normalize the relationship between humans and cannabis from a therapeutic perspective.  This is a broad issue that encompasses different knowledge fields such as public health, security, international relations, political economy and involves moral issues as individual liberty, human agency and inequality. In this context, this open panel seeks to bring together researchers dedicated to the theme of regulating the uses of cannabis with the aim of promoting a reflexive debate on the implications of these recent developments for the STS field and for society. Papers analyzing the prohibitionist paradigm and its political, economic, legal and scientific implications and the emergence of new modes of regulation and research on the use, cultivation, commercialization, production of sociability and knowledge about the plant are welcome. The proposal converges with the theme of the conference around Good Relations, the modes of knowledge production that link scientific practices with practices of solidarity and care, of combating structures of inequality and oppression, of relations between humans and non-humans, in a highly politicized field of studies and focused on the research of a morally saturated plant and whose connections with processes of domination over minorities are established in the scientific literature.

				Whether tendered as an intimately interpersonal exchange or in the form of technological and institutional interventions, care is constituted by quasi-economic practices of valuation and exchange. The work of care is also animated by economic and financial dynamics: caring practices are increasingly subject to commodification, rationalization, stratification, automation, and AI-ification/big data-fication. The COVID-19 pandemic has also revealed macroeconomies of care where regimes of value, ministration, provision, dispossession, and affective investment are established, contested, and endured. 
Articulating with the conference theme “Good Relations,” this panel invites interdisciplinary reflections on the ambivalent, generative relationship between the concepts of “care” and “economy.” Submissions might explore individual case studies of “caring economies” and/or theorize and speculate more generally: 
– How do practices of care function quasi-economically, empowering or dispossessing their agents and subjects?
– How do the values, perspectives, and methods of “the dismal science” affect social practices of giving and receiving care?
– How and where do caring practices intersect with economic forms and circulations? How and where are economies founded on practices of care? How, and to what ends, has care become economized, financialized, and commodified?
– How are caring economies scientized and rationalized, and to what ends?
– How do economic activities, discourses, and practices enable the provision or withholding of care?
– How do caring economies interact with established and emerging technologies for the care of others or the self? ",28,care, economy, value, affect, metrics,NA,NA,NA,Data and quantification,"Economics, Markets, Value/Valuation",Medicine and Healthcare

How do ethnographers negotiate the politics of care in interdisciplinary collaborations? Specifically, how can we enact and advance testimonial justice, mutual intelligibility, and reciprocality across unequal power relations and differences in disciplinary cultures and social identities?
How do ethnographers care about and for our collaborators, stakeholders, funders, careers and incomes, and commitments to justice at all stages of collaborative research, including project design, funding proposals, data collection and analysis, and knowledge dissemination?
What labor becomes visible when attending ethnographically to politics of care in interdisciplinary collaborations? What equitable relations become possible?
How is work distributed in integrative research, and what roles do disciplinary status, gender, race, ethnicity and sexuality play both in its allocation and recognition?
How do ethnographers navigate our status as insiders or outsiders, supporters or critics, or researchers or consultants?

				Despite its continued importance as an analytical category in the social life of south asia, and south asians globally, caste as a lens or a category of analysis has historically remained relatively undertheorized in the social studies of science and technology. If at all, caste has largely figured as an identity category in extant work. Can reframing the study of caste as a study of technoscience improve our engagements with caste as a social category as well as that of the social study of science and technology? What conceptual and methodological toolkit would such a move need? How are caste and technoscience intertwined? Is caste an historically morphing assemblage which shapeshifts as new sociotechnical arrangements become possible/are enabled by it? If so, what new ways of thinking about caste are enabled when we approach ‘caste’ as technoscience? And vice versa, what new ways of thinking about technoscience are enabled as we think about ‘technoscience’ as caste?
This panel invites papers that work with caste not only in axes of identity vis a vis technoscientific worlds but also think through caste as technoscience. These may range from case studies of sociotechnical assemblages that converge around different kinds of  “work,” debates around labour and caste relations, discursive efforts towards castelessness in the name of “merit,” to theoretical pieces that reflect on methodological concerns on the matter which address the co-construction and reification of the caste system through technoscientific practices, imagination and rhetoric in different communities of South Asia and its diaspora.

				Science and technology communities come in many forms, from the elite community of research scientists within the academy to the myriad grassroots communities that spring up to take direct action on technology policy issues. Yet despite this wide variation in technoscience communities, many continue to reproduce gendered patterns of exclusion visible in science and technology more broadly.
This panel provides space for critiquing community practices and structures of exclusion that contribute to limiting who can participate in the production of technoscientific knowledge, who can contribute to decision-making around policy and innovation priorities, and who gets to design the technological products and infrastructure that shape our lives. But, in line with this year’s theme of “good relations”, it also aims to celebrate successful inclusion strategies, to identify replicable practices for enhancing community diversity, and to highlight radical experiments in relationship-building and community development. We believe that this year, of all years, this celebration of progress is particularly important.
We welcome contributions–from any geographical location in the Global South or North–that explore feminist community inclusion strategies from a wide range of theoretical approaches. These could include (but are not limited to): communities of practice; space and place-making; social field theory; identity theory; affect theory; participatory design and co-design practices; and critical making.

				Though healthcare provides fundamental conditions of (im)possibility for life in the places we research, the workings of public (socialized, employment-based, welfare state) healthcare often remain both allusive and elusive in the studies of science, technology, and medicine (STM). While conceiving of healthcare provision, access, and policy as underlying analyses of biomedical knowledge production, patient-doctor relationships, and illness subjectivities, we seldom explore in depth the co-constitutive forces of the knowledges, practices, and technologies involved in producing, operating, maintaining, and transforming public healthcare. 
Healthcare structures index particular histories, ethics, and ideologies. They represent a foundational politics of life baked into institutions, pre-structuring care relationships, and organizing social life and membership. They can be a source of stability, solidarity, and social prosperity, much as they generate gaps and uncertainties, strategic ignorances and bureaucracies of exclusion. 
We invite fellow STM scholars to help us develop better vocabulary, methods, and theories for understanding and analyzing practices of administering and the administration of public healthcare. Topics may include:
– intersecting marginalizations (e.g. citizenship, housing status, disability, queerness, indigeneity, race, ethnicity, and gender) re/produced through limitations or intentional absences in healthcare access and equity;
– practitioners navigating professional mandates and practical constraints in administering patient care and resources;
– public healthcare governance across municipal, provincial/state, and federal scales;
– overlapping public-private responsibilities;
– public administration of identifying, diagnosing, and/or treating medical conditions;
– budgeting and legislating biomedical knowledges and healthcare resources;
– tacit knowledges, professional training and accreditation;

				Whether one characterises STS as an interdisciplinary field of inquiry, a full-fledge discipline, or otherwise, it is a body of knowledges and academic practices with its own core ideas, concepts, texts, journals, and professional associations. Yet education in STS is much less standardized than in other established fields and disciplines. While STS graduate programs exist in various forms and under various titles almost globally, undergraduate programs are much less common. Furthermore, given their interdisciplinarity, STS undergraduate programs face distinct sets of pedagogical and institutional challenges in terms of getting them established, as well as operating and maintaining them. At the same time, STS undergraduate programs are uniquely positioned to offer students with aspirations both within and outside the field, a set of theories, practices and methods that equip them to understand and address problems of inequality and uncertainty within our communities, institutions, and world.
We invite papers that reflect on the pedagogical and institutional dynamics of teaching STS and developing STS programs at the undergraduate level. Submissions can be connected -but are not limited- to:
•Undergraduate awareness of and general visibility of STS as a field
•Impacts of disciplinary dynamics within STS on education and programing  
•Interdisciplinary education

				While hurricanes, fires, floods, and droughts threaten much of the planet, the oil, gas, and coal industries are changing so rapidly that interpretation struggles to keep pace. Changes to extractive industries are in some cases linked to the climate crisis, but are also driven by global market perturbations, the Covid-19 pandemic, and other forces. In some interpretations, pressures on fossil fuel companies are opening up space for alternative technologies and lower-carbon imaginaries. From other perspectives, rapacious companies are finding ways to position themselves favorably in these rough waters, heeding the adage of “never let a good crisis go to waste.” In this paper session, we intend to address several questions about these processes of change. 
How are fossil fuel companies adapting to climate change, and even sponsoring climate adaptation initiatives? 
What are the dynamics of climate justice activism at the sites of fossil fuel production? 
How are the technosocial relations of fossil fuel extraction changing at different sites along the production chain in response to climate change and related crises? 
What new forms of expertise are authorized to deal with these industries? 
How do both experts and laypeople create knowledge that can help them understand and navigate the intersecting changes to the climate and the industries upon which they depend?

				In this panel, we consider the role of method in citizen science – broadly understood as a process in which communities and individuals perform scientific research with or without professional scientists.  Methods are fundamentally important in citizen science, for instance because they enable actors to generate data and validate scientific claims. Yet, the performative role of citizen science methods often remains obscured, as do the assumptions and values that inform them. As John Law (2004) has argued, research methods do more than “just describe social realities”; they are also involved in creating these realities. This raises the question of what kind of world we want to create with citizen science approaches. Acknowledging the growing number of citizen science practices in various disciplines (medicine, forestry, meteorology, ornithology, etc.) and the proliferation of these practices for a range of uses within the context of the Internet of Things (Gabrys 2018), we ask what the “methods” of citizen science entail and what they do: Which methods are deemed credible in citizen science? By whom and why? Which purposes do these methods serve? How are they conceptualized? How are they naturalized, problematized, or transformed? How are they communicated to wider audiences, and how are they received? Given the focus of the conference, presenters are encouraged to explore these questions from various angles, including non-western perspectives and contexts; and drawing on feminist, queer, transnational, and indigenous scholarship.

				Climate change and climate policies relate to various regimes of time: geological epochs, the long-term consequences of the use of fossil fuels, investment cycles, technology development trajectories, the length of regulatory and legislative procedures, the periods elected governments have executive power, tipping points and points of no-return, subjective time perceptions, and even eschatological vision of the end of times.
The panel ‘Climate change and the governance of time’ seeks to investigate how climate policies interrelate with different regimes of time, which challenges this poses and which novel issues arise. It is interested in particular in how different regimes of time problematize the coming-into-being of collective climate agreements and long-term collaborations; and how different institutions and technologies ‘mediate’ time regimes and connect and disconnect them to climate policies.
The panel welcomes empirical, normative, conceptual and speculative analyses regarding long-term climate policies that consider the relations between humans, other earthlings, climate change and policy in relation to their various cycles, rhythms and tempi. Taking into account questions of transnational, intergenerational and ecological justice, differences of scale and (uncertain) knowledge in the realms of the commons, our aim is to collect empirical and conceptual papers dealing with the large question of the governance of time in relation to climate policies.

				In these times of shifting climate relations, we find technoscience regimes bound up in assemblages of data produced with predictive models; data that shape the agendas of international political convenings; data about topics as disparate as temperature, displacement, and armed conflict; data that deal in narratives about the future while vying to mediate relations in the present. How do we responsibly make sense of predictive climate models, their data, their code, and their attendant relations of power? How might we responsibly unpack these data and models while intervening in processes through which they uphold and reproduce systemic forms of oppression? Dare we envision better or even good climate data relations?

Coastalization: Thinking global relations from the coast,"Arne Harms, Institute of Anthropology - University of Leipzig","Lukas Ley, U Heidelberg",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Posted: January 27, 2021
","
				
				
				Coasts are resurging worldwide, as centers of commerce, nodes in global supply chains, and geopolitical borders. Coastal areas are undergoing massive reconstruction as governments mobilize capital and technology to protect inhabited shorelines against storm floods but also undesired migrants. Coastal securitization and fortification – often large-scale infrastructure projects in the form of sea walls and military checkpoints – sit uneasily with conservationist concerns and human rights. Coasts are not just important sites of control and earth management but also zones of conflict and contestation, as indigenous groups and environmentalist organizations question plans for extensive land reclamation and unsustainable urban development.
This panel addresses the broader social and cultural consequences of coastal transformations through the concept of coastalization. We invite panelists to closely examine coastal infrastructures and their role in attracting and rerouting (un)desired flows of materials, ideas, and people. What types of connection and relations does the resurgence of coasts (re)produce? What are the new intersections of environment, economy, and power driven by coastal dynamics? We invite dense ethnographic accounts that explore the novel more-than-human connections created at water’s edge. Panelists may show new ways of dwelling at, protecting, building, and engineering shores. We are particularly interested in reterritorializations of coasts – spatial mutations and infrastructural shifts – that let coasts shape terrestrial and maritime worlds beyond the immediate material encounter of land and sea. Panelists may think with the coast as a “meeting place,” sites of multispecies entanglement, or conceptual figure to reveal the coastal moment in globalization.

","
				
				
				The nature of ‘going to work’ is changing in fundamental ways. First, AI-driven automation has the potential to displace increasingly-broad sets of roles, including an expansion into and beyond service roles traditionally performed by humans. Further, issues raised among research into the growing gig economy have brought to the fore the potential for unfair treatment and unjust employment dynamics among those undertaking short-term, self-directed work. Finally, workers possess, to an increasing degree, the necessary skills and expertise to automate significant portions of their own work, threatening their job stability and leading to what might be thought of as ‘self-obsolescence’. These workers may be newly or imminently displaced by novel implementations of AI, may find the circumstances of their work life to be substantially changed, or may have to operate under the often under-negotiated and under-secure conditions of the gig economy. Today, during what is perhaps the most dramatic period of growth in remote work, there is a growing need to closely examine collective organizing as job roles, daily practice, and even demographics shift alongside mediating technologies. With an eye toward the future of work, it is of pressing importance to consider whether the basic practices and roles of collective organizing still apply, or if they might need significant readjustment. In this panel, we invite papers that consider how workers can, do, and should advocate for themselves and act collectively.

				As a result of the devastation wrought by the COVID-19 pandemic, many newly under- and unemployed individuals have turned to Multi-Level Marketing companies (MLMs), which offer tempting rewards and the illusion of easy success. By forcing “independent contractors” to recruit friends and family, the MLM business model operates under an even more remorseless form of the “exploit or be exploited” capitalistic maxim, but these notorious ventures are only one example of the commodification of our social relationships. 
This panel will broadly address the ways personal relationships can be commodified, questioning the neoliberal economics and politics that promote the exploitation of our social lives. Some areas to consider include: hierarchies of friendship, often among women, within MLMs; recruitment and reward systems in cults and fundamentalist religious sects; social media and the quantification of friendship; the parasocial performance of intimacy within “influencer” culture; biotechnology companies gathering and selling genetic data; and other areas of study. When we have “good relations” with one another, how soon before those relations are mined for their commodity value? And how might awareness of this cycle allow individuals and communities to resist in creative, generative ways that foster even deeper connections? 
We welcome submissions that address topics from a variety of theoretical perspectives, including, but not limited to, social epistemology, feminist and queer STS, information studies, critical racial and economic justice, Indigenous ways of knowing, and disability studies. In bringing varied perspectives on commodified relationships into conversation with one another, this panel will support resistance through the formation of critical networks vigilantly aware of their potential for exploitation.

				Composting, as a feminist practice, has been taken up by an open, cross-institutional, trans-disciplinary reading and research group exploring the traces, legacies and relations between inclusive feminisms and broad Environmental Humanities over the last six years. The Composting Feminisms and Environmental Humanities group wishes to connect with composting kin around the world through this second open panel at 4S. At 4S 2018 we held a full day of interconnecting open discussions examining the transnational intersections between new environmentalisms and feminist STS. Forming good relations and worlding better worlds informs all of our endeavors, making 4S 2020 an ideal venue for Composting. 
The Composting group exists because although we cannot envision feminisms without attending to queer, Indigenous, anti-racist, anticolonial, crip, and other intersectional perspectives, often environmental thought neglects these questions. How might we attune ourselves to the ways in which new ideas are indebted to writings, readings and practices that have come before? How are feminist genealogies composted in and through the Environmental Humanities? What ethics of care and responsibility emerge from these ideas? What is yet to be added to the compost pile? We encourage submissions that continue the process of breaking down matters to re-emerge as new matters. Together we attune ourselves to the good (and fraught) relations that already exist and are yet to be formed between these modes of knowing.
To expand the conversation, submissions that queer the traditional format and offer creative provocations which embody the research are encouraged, including performances, ficto-criticism, art and speculative design.

				Despite the ongoing interest in the history, epistemology, sociology, and cultures of computing and its defining practices (see Benjamin 2019, Mackenzie 2001, Roberge & Castelle 2020), the study of computational media remains largely dispersed across a wide range of discipline specific venues. Inspired by the more systemic examinations of computing advanced by fields like critical AI studies, indigenous STS, and media anthropology, however, this open call aims to bring together scholars who share a similar interest in understanding the transdisciplinary complexities, alternative histories, and political a prioris behind computational media. 
With that intention in mind, we propose to consider computation as a paradigmatic ‘media technology’ whose entanglement with questions of both mediation and technoscience promises to renew the study of technical cultures at large. Computational media, we contend, provides a rich, boundary (defying) object around which the disciplinary perspective of media studies, history of technology, and science studies can be made to converge. Not only does computational media relate contemporary technoscience to the cybernetic and cyborgial origins of computing (see Haraway 1985, Hayles 1999, Medina 2011), it also forces us to consider mediation as a structuring principle of technoscientific cultures, practices and epistemologies (see Kittler 1986, Chun 2011). In that context, this open call invites scholars across fields to submit projects which both revisit dominant discourses surrounding the study of computational media as well as challenge the disciplinary frameworks in which they have been historically concentrated. All papers engaging historically, culturally, politically, sociologically, and/or materially with computational media are welcome.

				The world is at stake. Pandemics, climate change, species extinctions, and toxic waste confront policy-makers, scientists, artists, activists, and citizens from around the planet.
But what does it mean to be in a world? Are there many worlds or just one? And what kinds of worlds do we want to make? If worlds, as Donna Haraway writes, are not given so much as made, then what other worlds are possible? And how can they be brought into being? “Worlds” and “worlding” have emerged as productive theoretical and practical concepts in science studies as well as other fields. “World” is a seductive concept because of its expansiveness, drawing attention to the relationships between the global, the planetary, and the (other)worldly. Following Jakob Von Uexküll, “world” can make inroads into nonhuman or multispecies domains. “Worlding” inspires flights of imagination, as in the world-building stories of speculative fiction. “World” is helpful in thinking about incommensurabilities and alterities. Scholars have mobilized “world” to think of culture and context differently, as an alternative to fraught analytics such as the “global” or “scalability” and their imperial and universalizing ambitions.
In this session, we invite presentations that critically reflect on the ordering concept of “world” and to consider new directions for investigating the world or worlds in science studies. What does this concept afford us? How might worlds serve epistemically, ontologically, or politically? What are the ethical stakes of worlds or worlding?

				Techno-science, and the changes wrought by techno-science, frequently result in pushback. While such resistance can be grounded in attention to risks and social justice issues, this resistance can also take the form of conspiratorial reactions. From climate change denial to anti-vaccine movements, from fears of 5G towers to UFOs, from pseudoscience to conspiracy theories—instead of settling contentious debates, the creation of techno-scientific evidence has repeatedly led to conflict over what it is that particular evidence truly shows. Not simply consisting of a rejection of techno-science, conspiracy adherents marshal government documents and scientific reports in order to push for conclusions other than those found in those materials; with many conspiracy advocates learning to skillfully deploy the language of expertise in order to bolster, and spread, their claims.      
This session engages with the conference theme of “good relations” by approaching the matter of relations from the opposite direction. We seek to investigate the sorts of “bad,” “inappropriate,” “conspiratorial,” or “unforeseen” relations that emerge from modes of techno-scientific expertise and knowledge making. In what ways does the same evidence get mobilized by groups with differing agendas to advance bizarre claims? How have different media technologies afforded the efficient spread of such thinking? Beyond treating them as a source purely for concern or derision, what can (or should) STS scholars learn from studying pseudoscience and conspiracy theories? Beyond an assemblage of case studies, we hope our panel will demonstrate how views that are often treated as unserious deserve serious critical attention.

				Predicting and planning for the future is an inherently uncertain exercise. In the midst of unfolding health and environmental crises, forecasting the implications of different types of interventions is important but precarious. With exhortations from governments to ‘flatten the curve,’ simulation modelling has recently gained prominence in public consciousness as a potent tool informing COVID policies. The simplicity of the models stands in stark contrast to the complexity of the challenges at hand. This panel explores ways for STS to interpret and inform debates around ‘modelling’ practice and public understandings of models for the future. How and why are simulation models so seductive? How are models shaping concepts of ‘self’ and ‘future’? What kinds of knowledges and assumptions are built into these speculative exercises and what (or who) is left out? Can models help build ‘good relations’ between governments and citizens, or between diverse stakeholders approaching complex problems? 
The panel invites papers that engage with critical approaches to modelling practice and models as symbols circulating in complex systems. We also encourage papers that explore alternative methods for engaging in forecasting and scenario building that may better be able to encompass complex intervention dynamics and marginalized futures.

				The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic created a global crisis challenging humankind to develop as quickly as possible reliable knowledge about the virus and its devastating effects on our bodies and societies in order to minimize such harms. This situation of great uncertainty and enormous stakes incited a historically unique international knowledge producing effort by institutionalized scientists and research groups. While debate and disagreement exists within these scientific communities, more controversial are the various competing “outside” forms and sources of information on the virus and its mitigation strategies. Some are clear disinformation campaigns or far-fetched conspiracy theories, others are legitimate challenges to the temporary status quo. In the hyper-mobile context of knowledge production during an evolving pandemic, it is often hard to tell the difference. Questions such as ‘what information is reliable?’, ‘which experts should we follow?’, and ‘what (epistemic) authorities are to trust?’, take center stage in public debates. Prevalent clear-cut distinctions between “real” knowledge controversies and “fake” disruptions of scientific progress obscure the fact that the global quest for truthful knowledge about the virus is entangled with various (geo)political dynamics, government policy pressures, media reporting, platform moderation and public understandings of it all. STS scholars are perfectly equipped with concepts, theories and methods to help understand these complex dynamics involving uncertainty, changing insights, and (covert) manipulation. In this panel we invite scholars working on such “corona truth wars”: we welcome both empirical and theoretical studies on the cultures, politics and technologies of today’s corona knowledge contestations.

				Situated Computations is an approach to design and computation that grounds technologies in the social world by acknowledging the historical, cultural, and material contexts of designing and making. It acknowledges and responds to a setting’s social and technological infrastructures, and refuses to remain ignorant of economic and political structures that shape it (Noel 2020). In conversation with the conference theme, we invite scholarship that reflects on manual and digital practices to reveal ways in which existing and new oppressions in these sites are maintained or challenged. Our purpose is to examine manual and technological practices inside and outside academia through STS lenses of feminism, post-colonialism, and justice. We ask: How might analog and digital methods contribute to, destroy, or bridge long standing oppressions and strategic sortings of society? How might we conceptualize “good” relations in these practices to frame and enact new relations that confront colonialism, racism, and inequality? We invite works that explore theories, methods and expressions around craft, justice, and technology. How might praxis in situated computations help us identify and reclaim marginalized spaces? What new academic spaces might we reimagine to renegotiate and challenge power relations between those “inside” and those “outside” academia? What links may we draw between the lived experiences of craftspersons and the design of technological systems?

				Often considered a pinnacle of medical technoscience, solid organ transplantation and related interventional devices (ventricular assist devices, VADs; extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, ECMO) are described and hoped for as a new and improved state that achieves or approximates cure from serious end-organ disease. At the same time, notions of cure and biomedicine’s “curative imaginary” (Kafer 2013; Clare 2017) have come increasingly under scrutiny as hegemonic ways of knowing and experiencing futurities where health is seen as limitless and intervention inevitable. This open panel asks, “what futures materialize, when transplant medicine is brought into conversation with a critical stance that questions presuppositions about life, livability, difference, and thriving?” We invite those working at critical intersections in STS, particularly critical disability (“crip”) studies and feminist STS, to bring their practices and methods to bear on the field of transplantation as well as transplant-related technologies and sciences. We are especially interested in papers that reflect on futurity as an unstable horizon that requires innovation in methods and practices—from arts-based methods and research creation, to sound studies, to social geographies, to ethnography—how might a diversity of approaches in STS help to understand issues such as the liminality of being waitlisted, the challenges of adhering to strict regimens to preserve a transplanted organ, or the not-infrequent experience of graft rejection? We welcome a range of formats for presentation and will work with presenters to ensure that their work is accessible.

				Academic conferences are prime sites of exchange in global science. As events where face-to-face or digital encounters occur, they represent important nodes of knowledge circulation, and serve as spaces of research communication, academic identity formation, and networking. ‘Conferencing’ is recognised as an essential activity for building an academic career, which is manifested through the inclusion of conference participation and organisation in recruitment and promotion criteria. 
Conference participation, however, frequently requires access to resources that are distributed highly unequally – such as funding, visas, work-place permission, family support, and freedom from care responsibilities for the duration of an event. As such, academic conferences are sites of privilege and disadvantage, which may reproduce social inequalities in relation to gender, nationality, race/ethnicity, social class/caste, disability, language, and other intersecting dimensions of difference. 
This panel critically interrogates conferencing as scientific practice and its structuring effects in academia. It invites contributions that offer a) theoretical conceptualisations of academic conferencing/conferences; b) analytical syntheses of pertinent literature; c) empirical studies that examine how conferencing/conferences reinforce inequalities; d) methodologically-oriented explorations of researching conference inequalities; e) reflections on prevailing/changing conference practices in the light of a climate crisis and global pandemic.
Despite growing interest in conferences and an expanding evidence base revealing their adverse social and environmental effects, they remain a niche subject in the social studies of science. This panel seeks to provide an integrative discursive space to stimulate the formation of a scholarly network for future exchange, linking STS with higher education research and gender studies.

				This panel is concerned with how augmented reality is shaping personal identity and public communications, it’s social construction as media technology, and the outcomes of these trends for society. AR creates new kinds of digital relations for the physical world. It does not just layer over physical reality with virtual information (cf Azuma 1997, Kim et al. 2018), but helps us perceive and act in a world of novel personal, professional, and civic experiences. However, a dearth of knowledge on AR’s role in shaping and being shaped by society arrests the ability to steer AR’s social impact. And there is a clear and present need to do so: 2020 iPhones now incorporate novel AR-LIDAR surveillance sensors that map faces and the inside homes; there is growing acceptance of body-dysmorphic ‘lenses’ on social media that modify human appearance in real-time to, narrow, sexualise, add privacy, or otherwise reconfigure identity in public and private communication
This panel welcomes contributions across AR’s 1) Conceptualisation: how AR is imagined by those making AR experiences, as well as larger social discourses that enable and encourage its imaginaries; 2) Concretisation: how process of potential imaginaries succumb to market forces, civic pressure, technological limits, that deform any ideals of AR into material systems of media (Flusser, 1999) that design constraints towards specific properties and dynamics that mediate a specific reality; and 3) Contextualisation that reflects on how new media, despite their intended public debut, suffer continued social and cultural appropriation (Gitelman, 2006, p. 27).",50,Augmented Reality, Socialisation of Technology, surveillance, digital materialities, infrastructure,NA,NA,NA,Data and quantification,"Information, Computing and Media Technology",Infrastructure

				When it comes to computational methods in design, architecture, and the built environment, practices and relations aspire for “neutral” and “optimized” techno-solutions to design problems. Portrayal of these computational tools and methods as neutral platforms enabling participation in design hides the social, political, and racial entanglements involved in their creation and expansion (Nakamura 2014; Bridle 2018; Benjamin 2019). The narrative of neutrality conceals the power computer-aided design (CAD) software monopolies hold and absolves them from their negative social effects. It also obscures their values and relations to injustice, racism, and inequality. Another goal of the CAD industry is the continuous ambition for optimization which has gone through phases of form, fabrication, and now data (Marble 2018). Optimization through fabrication in computational architecture and design includes the push for industrial off-site construction with robotics, manufacturing assemblies, and technologies. Optimization through data includes new forms of automation and machine intelligence to free designers from the toll of  repetitive and non-creative tasks. In conversation with the 2021 conference theme, we invite scholarship that seeks to understand and uncover the power relations between (commercial) CAD systems, computational design practices, education, and their reproductions of oppressions at multiple scales. What does optimization really mean, and who benefits? What do we gain and lose in this never-ending goal of optimization and the apparent disappearance of humans from the process?

In this panel, organized by the coordinators of the STS Hub at San Francisco State University, we seek to bring together those who have established and participated in these novel initiatives to share research, approaches, achievements, challenges, and the situated practices that have facilitated their collaborative research. By sharing specific projects, practices, protocols, and methods that have emerged from our ongoing efforts, we aim to learn from each other’s labor and insights, to consider ways to collectively document these initiatives, and to create a network of mutual support and solidarity in our efforts to institutionalize more just STS research practices.

				What kinds of data have we produced at the local, national or transnational scale to deal and respond to Covid-19? Over the past year we have grown accustomed to measure, quantify, report, visualize, and account for all aspects of our lives. This has also come with a growing need for “valid” data and what it means to produce, share, circulate, and trust it. The assumption that data, especially more data, will lead to societal betterment is one that tends to pervade both academic conversations in data studies and public discourse. We do not argue against the importance of generating data in the face of local and global problems. Rather, we seek to challenge the assumption that critical analysis of, and intervention into, data infrastructures should happen primarily at the stage of data production. In conversation with citizen science studies the panel argues that data distrust must be taken as an integral part of data infrastructures and capacities—particularly in the context of the global south. This intervention is relevant in that it seeks to destabilize a globally adopted dichotomy that pits people who reject scientific findings against other forms of knowledge. It builds on the contention that data (dis)trust is not a “cultural” attitude of the public, but rather the result of situated processes through which frustration, uncertainty, and cynicism are enacted and produced. We are interested in understanding how data distrust—particularly around health and Covid-19—is produced and mobilized within various and transnational social fields and institutional settings.

				As digital data continues to rapidly proliferate, sustained by the ever-expanding architecture of the cloud, discussion of “data management” has become ubiquitous. Individuals, institutions, and states are all faced with the onerous work of organizing, culling, and keeping track of their data, raising questions that range from the stakes of self-archiving to the environmental costs of large-scale data storage. This panel proposes a new approach to these now-common problems, asking: does it make sense to talk about data care? 
When we center the people tasked with “managing” data in our analysis, questions of relationality inevitably arise. Is something like care at work when a data center technician sustains terabytes of data through his everyday practice, or saves it in the face of natural disaster? What kind of relating is at play in a researcher’s process of ensuring her data set is “clean”? What do intense affects associated with “data hoarding” and data loss (Dow Schüll 2017) tell us about normative expectations of care? By positing care as a flexible center point in this conversation, we aim to dig deeper into the relationships between people and the data they are responsible for. 
Topics of discussion may include, but are not limited to: 
– Design and maintenance of digital infrastructure
– Questions of data privacy, ownership, and sovereignty
– Emerging frameworks of data health and hygiene
– Non-human and new materialist approaches to data relations

While links between computer and biomedical sciences – particularly in relation to genomics – have been usefully sketched out (García-Sancho, 2011), much remains to be done regarding how biomedical data ‘got its bases’ (Haigh, 2009).
Second, how does data-based biomedicine effectively assemble technological (algorithms, chips, software) and organizational (consortia, standards, benchmarks) configurations, and how is this new ‘style of practice’ (Keating and Cambrosio, 2012) stabilized in a diversity of domains of biomedicine (e.g. cancer, infectious diseases, public health)?
Third, how are data of biological (e.g. ‘omics’ data), biographical and/or social processes (e.g. social capital, social belongings, patient-reported outcomes, scores of psychosocial complexity) assembled into data-based understandings of health and illness? Making data visible and reliable to as many practitioners as possible entails an increasing work to produce, relate, and standardize biomedical and socio-epidemiological data (Bossen et al., 2019). Through what inclusions/exclusions are bio-social ontologies of health emerging from the intelligibility and interoperability of these data?
In parallel to historical focus on path dependencies, the panel invites empirical and conceptual socio-anthropological contributions highlighting the disruptive alignments and frictions (Edwards et al., 2011) that shape data-based biomedicine.

				Who do you claim as your canonical ancestors in science and technology studies (STS)? In asking this question this panel aims to examine the history of STS thought by unpacking who are canonized, how they come to be recognized as the canonical figure of STS, and with what their research interests are concerned. In “Anthropology and the Savage Slot” Michel-Rolph Trouillot (2003) presents an intellectual crisis which postmodernism poses for anthropology, a crisis for its structural representation of the savage vs. the West and its linear progress of human civilization. To survive this crisis, Trouillot urges anthropologists to unearth and question the “savage slots” by reexamining “the construction of the Otherness upon which anthropology is premised” (p. 19). Prior to our current uncertain present and future of a global pandemic and a deeply-polarized U.S. politics, many STS scholars have vigorously debated whether STS is responsible for, or resistant against, the post-truth era (Lynch, 2017; Sismondo, 2017; Fujimura & Holmes, 2019). I seek to further advance this discussion by drawing on Trouillot’s proposition to critically examine upon what premise this discipline is professionalized, what forms of knowledge is produced and canonized or what forms of knowledge come to count as STS, what questions, practices and methods are deemed worthy of asking and doing, and what areas of the world are mainly covered in, or excluded from, STS research. In doing so, this panel seeks to decenter STS and critically examine with what historical and political forces STS are entangled. Finally, the panel invites scholars to contemplate: If you can claim your own kin in STS, who would that be?

				From widespread concerns over foreign interference in the 2016 US presidential election, to the more recent events of the Jan 6, 2021 ‘capitol siege’ in Washington, DC, the security of democratic society appears increasingly in question. Beyond the United States, far-right movements are ascendant, and the success of Brexit has troubled the international liberal order. Central to popular constructions of this ‘democratic insecurity’ has been the decline of traditional information gatekeeping by professional journalists and news media. With the rise of social media giants like Facebook and Twitter, new political possibilities have emerged to upset the status quo. While some have emphasized the democratic potential of the online grassroots, others draw attention to the growth of online extremism and its increasing influence on real-world events. Similarly, some have praised the moderation of social media content in the name of public safety, while others see it as a threat to the democratic values of free speech. But these views of ‘democratic insecurity’ are incomplete. Taking unsettled questions concerning the security of democracy, information, and technology, this open panel welcomes submissions that offer fuller accounts of the complex and changing relationship between technology, democracy, and security. We welcome a range of topics from diverse perspectives including:
cyberwarfare and cybersecurity
disinformation, fake news, and ‘post-truth’
online radicalization and extremism
election security
conspiracy theories
social movements
surveillance; failures of surveillance
online communities and ‘real world’ effect

				In recent years, an emerging concern over the amount of time that people spend in front of screens has led to pathologizing models of digital device use (i.e., “digital addiction”). Scientific research and corporate programs, such as Google’s Digital Wellbeing app or Apple’s Screen Time app, have constructed digital wellness, positing an ideal amount of digital device use, while also generating new understandings to expertise of “healthy” productivity, digital forms of parental supervision, and combatting physical fatigue, depression, and burnout.
Although engineers and psychologists have turned toward descriptions of digital overuse and addiction, other scholars have turned toward the so-called attention economy. While both groups of scholars may be critical of tech industry exploitation of users, they also tend to reinforce akratic models of users. In addition, the entanglements between digital wellness and health remain wedded to surveillance–especially through infrastructures for data collection and body tracking.
We seek papers that reevaluate digital wellbeing from a critical STS perspective and center aspects of social inequality inherent in digital wellness discourses. Topics may include: discourses surrounding home surveillance, children, and screens; the relationship between COVID-19 and screen time debates; digital labor and its relation to the possibilities and limits of political futures; how digital wellbeing experts and the psy-disciplines construct digital addiction; the relationship of digital wellness to the gig economy, platform labor, digital inequalities and global divides; or how digital wellbeing could be politicized and collectivized as a form of mutual aid and good relations.

				Disparities and oppression are evident in migrants’ everyday lives, exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of international migrants in 2019 approached 272 million, with 80 million forcibly displaced worldwide. As people move, or are restricted from movement, reliance on digital tools has grown to support social, academic, economic, and health dimensions of life. Remote data collection measures to conduct research with migrants and about migration is necessary to identify problems, support communities, and understand the complex social, technological, and political-economy of the changing world. This panel will focus on the critical questions that surface when conducting remote and/or digital research with migratory communities, broadly defined.
We aim to generate discussion about how or where the use of digital technology to collect research data might reproduce or interrupt colonial relations and dynamics of power. These can occur between researchers and participants, between differently situated participant groups, across research teams, or, throughout larger institutional systems of research and practice. How can we identify and better understand techno-colonial power and resistance in the adoption of digital data collection in migration research? How can digital research methods be used to foster participatory and/or anti-oppressive practices across time and place, related to race, class, gender, sexuality, age, and/or ability? How can an ‘ethics of care’ be applied to digital research? This open panel will bring together scholarship adopting digital data collection techniques, considering how to foster good relations across the axes of technology, research, power, privilege, and oppression in migration studies.",59,digital research, migration studies, transnational STS, techno-colonialism, anti-oppressive research,NA,NA,NA,"Information, Computing and Media Technology",Postcolonial STS,Transnational STS

				The lockdown experiences linked to Covid-19 have highlighted the central place of digital technologies in our daily lives. Access to rights, contacts with relatives, teleworking, eHealth: countless areas have been impacted. This context has given new impetus to the desire to deploy inclusive digital technologies. Beyond the issue of Internet access, the question of digital uses is becoming more central.
This call intends to bring together works that concern digital inclusion in practices. Contributions may deal with the following sets of questions:
1. Accompanying digital uses
According to what dynamics and what aims have digital inclusion mechanisms been put in place? Which actors are involved and which audiences are targeted? What are the accompaniment practices and postures? What place is given to the autonomy of persons?
2. Becoming digitally literate
How can the acquisition of digital skills be described? Can it be compared with the learning of other skills? What are the contours of “digital grammar” and what are the signs of its mastery?
3. Normatively framing digital uses
Do digital inclusion professionals have a dialogue with deviance specialists? What references and cultures, whether technical, legal or medical for instance, do they draw on in order to guide towards “good” uses of technologies? How is responsibility distributed among the different actors (parents, other careers, designers, etc.)?
This panel will privilege empirically-based contributions that favor a situated, relational, process-based and symmetrical approach of digital inclusion by taking into account both the point of view of accompanying people and of those accompanied.

				In this panel, we ask, how has the fact of diminished mobility changed our approaches to research? How has it changed our perspectives on the relationship between researcher and field site? What does it mean to do fieldwork closer to the places we call home in light of pandemic-related travel restrictions?
We suggest that lived experience is too often undervalued in the institutional production of knowledge, even or especially when knowledge is centered on some specific place. Despite this ingrained bias against the local, we propose that being from a place can afford a kind of “double vision” of the sort that Sandra Harding and other feminist STS scholars have theorized, whereby scientists, including social scientists, “and their communities be integrated into democracy-advancing projects for scientific and epistemological reasons as well as moral and political ones.”1
In staying closer to home, what alliances do we form or strengthen? Do new forms of reciprocity emerge? How does the dimension of lived experience inform our projects, when our field sites and personal geographies overlap? How do we self-situate in these contexts, whether as Indigenous, Native, local, settler, visitor, or some combination of these? How do we engage Indigenous and decolonizing methodologies responsibly? What are the potential pitfalls?
We invite researchers to share their experiences, insights, and methods relating to these questions around field site selection in an era of diminished mobility. We welcome loosely scripted presentations in various media and hope to make time at the close of this panel for an open-ended conversation.

				Ours is a time of division and fractures—a time of crises. Given the urgent problems we must face, there is no guarantee on predicting how the agents involved, both human and other-than-human, will respond, let alone forcing one set of conditions upon them, or using them at will. In fact, we can only be certain of the divergence of obligations and requirements of the diverse parts involved (Stengers 2011).
The unstable and heterogeneous landscape of current and urgent problems calls for a radically different role for scientific practices. In this new role, they should aim to neutralize divergences, securing one expert consensual take, but rather strive to take part in a heterogeneous and ecological assembly. If we don’t take scientific practices nor the experts that they produce to be the great deciders, what role should they play? How should they behave? In what terms must they present themselves?
This is the central problem of diplomacy, as Isabelle Stengers (2005, 2020) understands it. Diplomacy is a device to render different voices equal –not interchangeable, but equally present. A diplomatic practice comes out from a group and does not necessarily seek a common ground, but merely to add their voice to the process of making a difficult decision. Our aim is to consider the political impact that different practices –related to ecological and social problems, multispecies conversations, methodological aspects of STS, or others– could have and how would they behave when rooted in diplomacy.

Disciplinary Translations in Science and Society,"Barbara Kirsi Silva, Universidad Alberto Hurtado",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Posted: January 27, 2021

				Recent events worldwide have shown the relevance of interdisciplinary approaches to cope with uncertainty: the current pandemic and sanitary crisis, social and political protests, climate emergency -among many others- prove the need to think—and act —in novel and creative ways. More than disciplines examining phenomena from different standpoints, innovative interdisciplinary approaches need to conceptualize past and emerging problems from assemblages at the interaction of various fields. In this way, effective interdisciplinary studies could contribute to understanding our world from a more complex, dense, and purposeful perspective.
At the crossroads of society and science, STS offers a strong potential to trespass traditional knowledge production boundaries. This panel seeks to explore the role of “disciplinary translations” in studying science and societies. Disciplinary translations refer to the transfer of concepts, ideas, frameworks produced in science and applied to understand social dilemmas and vice versa. To mention just a few examples, there have been experiences of applying complex models of physics to understand social networks; chaos theory to study social behaviors in crowds; chemical transformations in matter to analyze historical processes. This panel aims to bring together proposals from different fields exploring this post-disciplinary approach to both science and society. Additionally, the purpose of this panel is to discuss how STS could contribute to shaping both compelling and effective interdisciplinary knowledge production.

It aims at bringing  together efforts in scholarly practice—including art-based methodologies and activist-oriented research—to historically, politically, and socially situate disease, toxins, pathogens, non-humans, and bodily dysfunction in violent geographies produced by legal and illegal extractivism. We ask how the health conditions of the environment and the body become entangled in places dominated by extractivist economies. What difference does it make to tell stories of armed violence, gendered and racialized dispossession, capitalism, mining, and agrarian expansion through human and more-than-human experiences of health and illness? How are evidence and ignorance about bodies and landscapes produced, used, and abused in contexts marked by extractivist activities? And finally, what practices, methods, and interventions are helpful to establish good relations, capable of disrupting the combined production of disease and violence in old, new, and future territories of extraction?

Disempowerment and Empowerment with Autonomous and Intelligent Systems,"Greg Adamson, IEEE SSIT",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Posted: January 27, 2021

				The relationship between technology, disempowerment, and empowerment is indisputable, but complex. Technologies of warfare have helped maintain unequal power relationships throughout history, while diffusion of technology has enabled mass literacy and widespread health care. “Power and AI” is a common subject in media today, often through a public policy lens, but is less often addressed in technology narratives.
The panel is initiated by the IEEE Society on Social Implications of Technology and the IEEE Standards Association’s Ethically Aligned Design. IEEE is a professional association of technologists with 420,000 members in 160 countries.
We are seeking to build an open community looking at empowerment and disempowerment in the development of technologies today.
The panel will be structured around three aspects: the historical legacy of disempowerment including long-standing structural oppression, which frames our technology development today; the current forms through which technology contributes to the creation and maintenance of power relations today; and issues which those developing technology should consider when seeking to create technologies which empower communities, rather than disempowering them. This has particular importance in the development of autonomous and intelligent systems.
While related to discussions of ethical design in technology, considerations of power and technology are distinct, drawing directly on the work of anthropologists, sociologists and other social scientists, legal practitioners, and those in the humanities, among others. The panel will provide insights and guidance to those developing technology, from policy framers to implementation practitioners, and we invite those interested to take part.

Likewise, the panel is also intended to connect creative practice to STS in order to find our way past the constrictions of academic hierarchies and boundaries in order to “strive towards good relations as humans, with technologies, in our modes of knowing, within environments, across distance, and with other-than-humans” (4S2021 Conference Theme). The goal is for several short (10-20 minutes each) live performances, dances, readings, or artist presentations to be “staged” alongside complimentary STS research in ways that give permission for the nonlinear and nonquantifiable to matter as much as the logical and measurable. The “creative” panelists can be professional or nonprofessional artists; the STS scholars can also present a creative performance. Perfection is not expected; learning from the process as both giver and receiver is what matters.

				This panel invites papers that studies efforts to make engineering and engineering education more inclusive, diverse and caring.  Engineers engage in design, development, testing, modifying, installing, inspecting, monitoring and maintaining a wide variety of infrastructures, systems and products. They make recommendations, evaluate, supervise, consult and some of them teach future engineers in colleges and universities. Engineers potentially play a pivotal role in designing for a more diverse, inclusive and caring society in the future.
We call for papers that analyze attempts to make engineering more diverse and/or caring. This could be efforts to redefine engineering practices or engineering education. Broadly speaking, this include studies of initiatives to transform engineering practices, organizations and cultures to make them more caring, ethical, diverse and inclusive and thus helping to develop a more sustainable society that protect people, cultures, communities and environments. It also invites papers about how to make engineering more welcome and inclusive for groups and minorities. It also welcomes paper discussing the need to change the understanding of engineering and what engineers are for, what changes that are called for, and what this may mean for engineering identities. Further, we welcome critical reflections on research practices, methodologies, language and perceptions in engineering studies, including the performativity of engineering studies and reflections on what represent good relations for engineering as well as reflections on how the field may configure engineers and engineering work and education.

				This panel explores what we expect of scientists when we talk about care, particularly in the
context of practical applications of STS such as training, education, or interdisciplinary research. Much has been written of late about care as a way of figuring responsible relationships and practices in science. Care is proposed as an organising device which, in acknowledging the interdependence of humans and nonhumans and the diversity of their needs, can promote attention to those needs and the development of more compassionate and nurturing worlds. This notion of care is inspiring, but what do we actually expect of scientists when we ask that they care? 
In this panel, we aim to explore encounters between scientific and STS communities where our expectations that scientists care are made explicit. These encounters might consist of
responsible research and innovation training, interdisciplinary research, ethnographic work,
teaching, or other avenues where we foreground our expectations that scientists care. The aim is to try to bring our expectations into focus, helping us to better engage with scientists and to work alongside them to develop more caring worlds.
We welcome theoretical, empirical, arts-based, or activist work which explores care expectations in, e.g., learning outcomes, assessment frameworks, speculative work, or reflexive work.
Contributions might address issues such as:
 the tensions between individual and institutional responsibility,
 the issues associated with the gendered, raced, and (dis)abled emotional labour involved in care,
 the uneven capacities of different career-stage researchers to care,
 the differing meanings of care across communities, disciplines, and cultures. ",68,Care expectations, STS practice, responsible research and innovation, engagement, emotional labour,NA,NA,NA,Governance and Public Policy,Method and Practice,Science Communication/Public Engagement

				The goal of this panel is to address the role time and temporality in knowledge production in science and technology. The foundational assumption for doing so is to  shift the basis for time studies in the human and social sciences, even in parts of natural sciences, and challenge the centuries-old metaphysics that time is in reality abstract, universal, and intangible. Abstract time lives on in different forms: as a dimension of reality (Newton), a form of cognition (Kant), as an object of 20th- and 21st-century physics (Smolin, Barbour), or simply, in every-day time management practices, like clocks and calendars. This panel aims to offer an innovative approach. It aims to explore the opposite assumption: that time is always concrete, local, and tangible, ordered and re-ordered, made up of practices, materials, technologies, i.e. humans and nonhumans. Time – particularly its “ownership” – is also a critical parameter structuring power relations in knowledge production. Time is what we do when we measure, manage, or conceptualize orders of succession and change, but also everything that is involved in them. These practices exist and can be understood without recourse to any real, absolute, hidden time, accessible only to God or physicists.  The panel thus invites presentations that explore these doings and makings of time, as a way of generating a new STS-laden approaches to time; time, which is also nominalist, empiricist, and historicist. The panel’s other objective is to follow and expand on several successful time-oriented panels that took place in Boston, Sydney, New Orleans and Prague.

				Modelling, a scientific practice once reserved for mathematicians, epidemiologists, ecologists and economists, has assumed sudden authority in the covid-19 pandemic. The commanding presence of models in global policy has prompted questions about evidence, reliability and trust. Predictions and forecasting, grounded in formalised assumptions, have shifted the landscape of acceptable evidence in global public health. Moreover, modelling became popular: scores of armchair epidemiologists shared their newfound wisdom, the R-number and “exponential growth” became household terminology, while hashtags like #flattenthecurve entangled “science into social practices, calculations into materialisations, abstracts into affects.” (Rhodes et al 2020)
In this panel, we will survey how pandemic modelling made relations since early 2020. We will reflect on the unprecedented ways in which pandemic modelling engaged with unequal and uncertain worlds. We encourage two kinds of contributions: 1) papers which consider the impact of pandemic modelling on knowledge production, policymaking and social relations in pandemic times. Such papers might ask what models do and how they perform as evidence and how modelling has shifted, accelerated or reconfigured persisting challenges of inequality, racism and colonialism. Authors might pay attention to local, regional or national frames of reference. 2) Papers, which investigate the making of relations within models and scrutinize how practices of modelling enfold social, geographical, ecological and microbiological assumptions when forecasting the pandemic world. We invite papers focusing particularly beyond Europe and North America to ask what constitutes good relations within modelling practices, and how we might reconcile these with an ethics of care, responsibility and solidarity.

				One explanation for the fragile state of hospital sectors around the world during the COVID-19 pandemic can be assumed in the diffusion of economization efforts. The financialization of medical care created organizational weak points: work intensification, bureaucratization and increasing managerial control led to an exhausted work force and an economy of scarcity. However, different groups of hospital staff are affected differently: Physicians, clinical scientists, biomedical researchers, (study) nurses and management – among others –  are each characterized by specific professional tasks like medical treatment, research or management. We want to understand, how do they cope with the changed organizational setting and its inherent contradictions? Do new tasks, career patterns or professions emerge as a result? Furthermore, do the organizational changes of inpatient health care also affect the conditions for knowledge translation? Finally, what are the compounding effects of the external shock of the Covid-19-pandemic and economization efforts on the organization of inpatient health care? We invite empirical and theoretical papers discussing these and related research questions:
•	How is health care staff affected in its daily practice by the organizational change due to economization efforts?
•	What kind of behavior is developed to cope with altered framework conditions?
•	Does the financialization of health care change the organizational conditions for professional knowledge translation?
•	How is the financialization of health care affecting the response to the COVID-19-pandemic?
By answering these research questions, the panel contributes to ongoing STS debates on the complex interrelation of healthcare, (medical) translation and financialization.

Emergence in Environmental Infrastructures,"Akshita Sivakumar, University of California at San Diego",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Posted: January 27, 2021
","
				
				
				This panel will engage the concept of emergence in environmental infrastructures. Emergence here is considered broadly to include the becoming of practices, discourses, and relations in excess of planned, material infrastructures for the valuation and control of environmental resources be they water, land, air, or other. Emergence is a familiar concept in complex systems theory that describes self-organizing systems like flocking and more generally describes anything that results beyond a mere sum of parts. The study of infrastructure is one of STS’s longstanding concerns regarding the commonplace sociotechnical systems that support the circulation of materials, people, and knowledge (Star and Ruhleder; Chattopadhyay; Bowker; Edwards et. al.; Anand, Gupta, and Appel; Simone). Yoked together, emergence in environmental infrastructures includes unanticipated outcomes that can influence material processes, practices, interdependencies, scripts, instruments, and institutions on a variety of spatial and temporal scales. 
We welcome papers that engage with questions such as: How can the concept of emergence deepen our understanding of the effects of environmental infrastructures? What can it tell us about implicated communities and technical systems and their corresponding epistemologies, ontologies, attunements, and politics? How can emergence in turn influence how we observe, analyze, document, and publicize environmental issues? We invite intersectional approaches that engage feminist, decolonial & postcolonial science and technology studies in order to gather expansive ways to identify relations and discourses that emerge from environmental infrastructures within conditions of inequality and uncertainty.

Scientists, biohackers, patients, regulators, bioethicists, disability justice advocates, venture capitalists, biopharma and agriculture firms, among others, are contributing to and contesting the development of institutions for governing these biotechnologies. Key to these dynamics are the discourses, processes and practices through which existing scientific, social, political, economic and ethical orders are disrupted, co-produced, and stabilized to form emergent orders, and how and why some possibilities are opened while others are constrained. 
This paper session invites research that examines and explores the intertwined development of genome editing technologies and social institutions from diverse perspectives and contexts, and across different applications (e.g. agriculture; health and biomedicine; environmental management and gene drives). What discourses, processes, practices and norms are important for governing these novel biotechnologies? How is increased access to and expanded use of these biotechnologies reconfiguring existing social and institutional orders, and leading to new ones? How can we imagine and enact more democratic forms of engagement with and governance of novel biotechnologies? Overall, we are interested in developing a comparative and critical picture of the emergence of new social orders as the ability to modify DNA becomes commonplace, and in doing so, identify sites where existing inequalities or asymmetries of power are reproduced and can be addressed.

				New encounters between Biology and Engineering are reconfiguring social and epistemic landscapes of the contemporary knowledge production and innovation in the Life Sciences. Over the last years, approaches as Systems and Synthetic Biology bring great debates to the research on Science and Technology Studies (STS), History and Philosophy of Biology and Biomedical Sciences, and Bioethics (Calvert and Fujimura, 2011; Schyfter and Calvert, 2015; Schyfter, 2020). This literature is strongly oriented to the analysis of emerging academic agendas, discourses, practices, conventions and promises of those fields, addressing a broader understanding of its epistemological foundations and societal implications. Systems and Synthetic Biology are well-succeeded in idealizing new ways to engineering biomedical knowledge and commercializing solutions to science, industry and medicine. Ethical, Legal and Social Implications (ELSI) of Systems and Synthetic Biology is as a great deployment of this debate and should be object of more STS-driven research. This Open Panel invites papers related to the study of practices in Systems and Synthetic Biology (in academia, policy-making, industry, medicine, etc.) and its ELSI in contemporary world. We welcome work on: new movements of engineering biological knowledge, emerging social and epistemic arenas on Systems and Synthetic Biology and its ELSI, bandwagon studies, bioethical issues in translational research, etc. We are particularly keen to encourage submissions from History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences, Science and Technology Policy, Sociology and Anthropology of biomedicine, Bioethics, etc. The panel aims to help expand and update a network of researchers working in this field globally ",74,Systems Biology, Synthetic Biology, knowledge production, ELSI, Bioethics,NA,NA,NA,"Genetics, Genomics, Biotechnology",Medicine and Healthcare,Other
Encounters With Failure In STS,"Jessamy Perriam, IT University of Copenhagen",Katrine Meldgaard Kjær,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Posted: January 27, 2021

				Science and Technology Studies has long focused on how knowledge is made and how publics are then enrolled in it. However, these past studies have often focused on successful articulations of knowledge; we argue that what is left behind, discarded or disputed is just as generative and important to research. While not exhaustive, these may include failures in policy, failures of pilot schemes or mundane failures in everyday life. Moreover, failure also occurs in relation to research processes. In research we can, for example, encounter absences in our data where perhaps we expected it to be. This can in turn make us unable to narrate and analyse the processes that enrol publics in the various failures that stand in relief to what becomes successful. What methods might exist or be developed to help discuss and analyse failure in the face of absent data, missing voices and actors for whatever reason we struggle to follow?
This panel is primarily focused on the methods involved in researching failure or doing research in the face of failure or absence. As such, we invite papers that deal with one or both of these areas. We also welcome papers with a focus on digital methods or inventive methods. Due to the subject of the panel, we also encourage papers which reflect research projects at different stages of the research process. This panel aims to start and progress conversations amongst  researchers about how conduct studies amongst failures and absences.

				Science and technology are widely regarded as guarantors for increasing welfare and solving societal problems. Especially, so-called “grand challenges” (e.g. Climate change, energy transition, mobility turn) are to be solved with scientific and technological means. STS scholars so far analyzed the aligning changes as emergence of mission-oriented research, formation of transdisciplinary research practices or the transformation of science-policy interfaces. However, multifaceted changes within science itself while absorbing these complex problem situations are taking place. These are less investigated, yet.
In order to make complex systems explorable, science resorts to specific techniques: on the one hand, increasingly advanced computer technologies such as simulations and, increasingly, machine learning methods; on the other hand, strategies of engineering de novo entities such as precedentless materials, molecules or organisms in order to reduce complexity. Thus, research cultures are going to change and fundamental questions have to be addressed anew. It is not only about understanding the changes in “epistemic cultures” (Knorr Cetina), but also to understand these changes in the light of the epistemological question of how can we understand and confirm epistemic quality?
Against this background, this open panel is dedicated to the double question: Which changes of research cultures happen while addressing these forms of complexity? How can we describe these changes of epistemic quality in terms of fundamental epistemological categories (e.g. explanation, epistemic thing)? Our basic assumption is that there is a need for reshaping STS by an interdisciplinary approach combining philosophy of science as well as STS forms of investigation.

				 In ethnographic inquiries of urban atmospheres, biosocial relations and bodies as practiced, social science scholars situate subjective, embodied experiences in between organisms and environments (Mol 2002, Blackman 2008, Ingold/Palsson 2013, Blok/Farías 2016, Meloni et al. 2018; Seeberg et al. 2020). In doing so, they emphasize how bodily processes are permeated by environmental conditions. However, the adequacy of these approaches for the concomitant embodiment and ecological relationality of ‘mental’ experiences has hardly been addressed directly (among the exceptions are Fitzgerald et al. 2016 and Winz 2018). Relatively few ethnographic research projects attend to the mutual constitution of ‘the mental’ and ‘the environmental’ (Amin/Richaud 2020; Bister et al. 2016).
In this panel, we seek to fill this research gap through empirically grounded ethnographic inquiries into ‘mental phenomena’ as part of ‘urban’ life. Our discussion embraces the following conceptual and methodological challenges: How can we grasp elusive aspects of experiences in and of the city as dynamic co-constitutive relations between material environments, cultural practices, subjective experiences, and urban infrastructures? What concepts, methods, and research designs are suitable for combining experience-based approaches (Söderström et al. 2016) with an inquiry in ecologies of expertise (Beck 2015) that shape the urban fabric? What is left of ‘the mental’ if we problematize it ‘environmentally’? How does our research affect how we conceptualize ‘the urban’? Finally, how could our studies inform the design of cities and the crafting of urban cohabitation (Bates et al. 2017)?",77,ethnography, urbanity, mental life, ecology,NA,NA,NA,NA,Environmental/Multispecies Studies,Method and Practice,NA

				Why is transnational STS needed and what does it look like in practice? What relationships and infrastructures does transnational STS depend on, perpetuate, and challenge? This open panel will explore different reasons and ways people pursue transnational STS, considering transnational STS a method and project design challenge. This open panel extends from extensive dialogue about TRANSnational STS at the 2018 annual 4S conference in Sydney, which spawned an array of new collaborations and further conversation. This open panel is intended to keep the dialogue going and open, taking transnational STS in new directions. In line with the theme of the 4S 2021 Toronto Conference, the panel will approach transnational STS as a space to work out decolonial, anti-racist and anti-authoritarian relations,  supporting vibrantly pluralistic knowledge production. The aim of the panel is to juxtapose different approaches and projects, learning across their differences.  We encourage papers that present past, on-going or imagined transnational projects, drawing out what they aim to achieve, what they are designed against, their workflows, modes of collaboration, infrastructures and governance. Contributions may address, among others, the following questions:
-What motivates transnational collaborations in STS and what do they aim to achieve?
-What methods and infrastructures are used in transnational STS projects?
-How are data in transnational STS projects shared and managed?
-How are transnational STS research projects administered and governed?
-What relationships are engendered and valued in transnational STS projects?
-How have differences in political contexts shaped transnational STS projects?
-What challenges have emerged in transnational STS projects? What is needed to move through them?
-How have transnational STS projects actively leveraged diverse intellectual genealogies?
-How have transnational STS projects been proactively anti-imperial?
-What has been learned in transnational STS projects about the workings of  “team science” and international research networks?

				In our unequal and uncertain world, we argue that quantification in global governance could be seen as an ‘epistemic infrastructure’. This infrastructure is ‘relational’, embedded in structures, technologies, and social arrangements learned as part of becoming a member of a global community (Star 1999). While quantification in global governance is framed to create ‘good relations’ between human and non-human actors in global networks, it simultaneously ‘infrastructuralizes’ these materialities, networks, and practices to create new global governance paradigms: an example of such an infrastructure are the Sustainable Development Goals. 
Scholarship on the role of numbers in governing societies is abundant in multiple disciplines. Prominent authors have written lucidly about the role of numbers in the making of modern states and the governing role of measurement regimes in public policy and social life (Alonso and Starr 1987; Hacking 1990; Porter 1995; Espeland and Stevens 2008). Similarly, anthropologies of numbers suggest that ‘our lives are increasingly governed by – and through – numbers, indicators, algorithms and audits’ (Shore and Wright 2015:23; see also Merry 2011; Sauder and Espeland 2009; Strathern 2000). Further, important insights and perspectives on indicators in particular come from STS (Bowker & Star 1999; Lampland & Star 2009), including actor network theory (Latour 2005). 
Drawing on these literatures, this panel invites papers that explore various dimensions of the rise of metrics in global governance. In particular, we aim to identify new empirical and theoretical approaches to quantification as the ‘epistemic infrastructure’ that holds and steers global knowledge production and governance.

Equality By Design Vs Design For Appropriation In Digital Resource Sharing,"Léa Maria Stiefel, Unil","Alain Sandoz, IIUN",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Posted: January 27, 2021
","
				
				
				Several scholars in STS (in platform and infrastructure studies, Plantin et al. 2018; see also in Internet studies, Dulong de Rosnay and Musiani 2020) have pointed to architectural features of profit-driven global digital infrastructures, e.g., GAFAM, that lead to concentrations of power, discrimination and inequalities.
Conversely, egalitarian applications such as on-line peer-to-peer production platforms tend to fail the test of scaling up small communities of participants to egalitarian dynamics in large groups, thus sometimes falling back into profit-driven, hierarchical, and discriminatory modes of operation (Tréguer et al. 2020).
The panel proposes to consider the problem of (in-)equalities and discrimination in information- (and possibly other resource-) sharing systems not as a consequence of system structure nor platform usage; rather, we encourage taking the opposite perspective: can inequalities be avoided from the outset. How can discrimination be hindered by the design of adequate architecture mechanisms for equality? What is the role of STS scholars in engaging with the design phase of systems?
The panel invites empirical contributions where equality is considered, negotiated, contested in a system’s architecture as an initial design value. The user communities of these systems need not to be large, nor their mode of function to be peer-to-peer. Contributions are invited to describe how the value of equality was designed in these projects and how it was to be integrated in, promoted by, or supported by the system’s architecture.

				Around the world, populations await their shot at vaccination for COVID-19. A paradigmatic example of biomedical triumphalism, vaccines promise a way out of the current crisis and back to life as we knew it. Much attention has been on how limited vaccine supplies can be distributed and distributed equitably, especially in the context of perceived ‘market failures’ in low-and middle-income countries. But proposed solutions such as pooled vaccine procurement schemes and allocation frameworks, while undoubtedly important, arguably also render equity as primarily a distributional problem that arises only after the development of biomedical products. 
Seeking to draw on and further expand work in STS that highlights how questions of politics and ethics are integral to the production of scientific knowledge and products (Puig de la Bellacasa 2011, Barry 2005), this panel invites empirical and conceptual contributions that explore how concerns about equity have been addressed – and may be addressed differently – in the development of biomedical tools, whether therapeutic, diagnostic or prophylactic like vaccines. 
We invite papers that address a range of relevant questions: 
How is the problem of equity posed by those involved in R&D, including scientists, regulators and policymakers?
What are proposed solutions (e.g. governance, regulatory and financing mechanisms, IP flexibilities, market-based mechanisms, but also efforts related to the design and development of biomedical products themselves)?
How do such techniques operate in practice, when may they be considered successful and where do they risk reproducing or ‘innovating’ (Benjamin 2016) inequities?

				In recent decades, several international organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the European Commission and the World Economic Forum have stated that nation’s progress must be understood in a broader set of ideas, including not just technological innovation but also social innovation (SI). Although the term has been used in sociological discourses and other disciplines since the late 19th century, SI has gained real attention in academia and political discourses since the beginning of the 21st century. There are several conceptions about SI; the term is used differently across diverse disciplines. Conceptions go around “doing something good within or for society”, “changing social practices and/or structure”, or “contributing to rural and community development”. Likewise, there is an exponential growth of academic literature dealing with SI, so that an increase of success experiences is presumed. Like this, it is also presumed that SI is becoming the most convenient innovation paradigm to face the social, economic, political and environmental challenges of the 21st century. In response to this outlook, through this open panel we invite STS scholars to join a discussion on SI that presents empirical research results, showing evidence of specific SI processes, as well as perspectives that allow feedback on emerging practices, experiences and application. Our discussion will enrich the 4S annual meeting Toronto 2021, since SI cases usually account for different modes of social collaboration, and they are understood as processes, whereby new forms of social relations lead to societal change.

				Facing an untamed pandemic, governments have leveraged public trust and perhaps health in facilitating good relations with industry in co-producing innovative health products in record time. Established evidence-based medicine standards have been overshadowed by the deployment of new regulatory mechanisms such as Emergency Use Authorizations (in the US and UK), Interim Orders (Canada), and Conditional Marketing Authorizations (European Union) that have expedited Covid19 diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines to an anxious public, despite partial and uncertain clinical trial “results.” To unpack this trend, which capitalized upon pre-pandemic social alliances and regulatory modernization agendas that emphasize agility, flexibility and innovation, and its impact upon the future of health product regulatory practices, we welcome papers from science studies scholars that address one or more of the following lines of inquiry:
•	Investigating the shifts in regulatory approaches, practices, and responses that confirm or counter the perceived erosion in evidence-based appraisal of health products;
•	Offering theoretical, empirical and especially ethnographic findings that characterize the political economy or structural drivers of the changes in health product governance before and/or during the pandemic, and their implications for post-pandemic futures;
•	Attending to new modes of biopharmaceutical knowledge production, including alternative therapies, such as psychedelic-assisted therapies, that disrupt entrenched relations between regulators and ‘big pharma’ in the wake of Covid19 and evolving standards of safety and effectiveness.

","
				
				
				Food and agriculture systems offer rich case studies for interrogating how the politics of expertise and knowledge continue to evolve in unsettled, uncertain times. Traditionally, STS scholarship has focused on the epistemic politics of expertise: for example, dominant institutions and actors have long granted scientific and technical expertise greater legitimacy and authority, compared to other forms of knowledge production.  Now, the advent of emerging agrifood technologies – such as CRISPR-Cas, farm automation, lab-grown meat, and big data – has reinforced technologically-centered knowledge making that promises greater control over nature while gesturing to more equitable, inclusive, and diverse outcomes. Similarly, the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed many struggles over expertise in food and agriculture. Public health experts, health departments, food companies, and government agencies struggled within and against partisan politics to establish credibility, often sidelining the embodied knowledge and agency of workers on farms, in supermarkets, and at meat processing plants. Who is most knowledgeable about workplace conditions, worker life, risk and exposure, and health and safety? What becomes of the ‘undone science’ and unpracticed expertise in realms of agroecological, field-based, and observational modes of producing knowledge about nourishment? How do the racial justice protests that have erupted on the world stage in 2020 draw our attention not only to policing and surveillance as S&T-mediated forms of racial oppression, but to how seemingly neutral and depoliticized food and agriculture S&T research, artifacts, and applications can propagate racial oppression and settler-colonial worldviews? This panel welcomes papers on a wide range of expert politics on such topics in food systems. We are particularly interested in papers that critically evaluate the nature and meanings of food-related expertise and knowledge in these broad three areas: new technologies, the pandemic, and racial justice. We also encourage papers that draw on diverse methods as well as traditional STS methods, including participatory action research, media analysis, scholar-activism, community organizing, multi-species perspectives, the arts, and humanities.

				Where the 2020 pandemic prompted new desires for hyper-sterile environments, it also sparked interest in the microbe-rich world of fermentation. Home kitchens, wiped clean with bleach and sanitizer, produced effervescent brews, doubling sourdoughs, and funky sauerkrauts. Fermentation provided a collaborative ‘contamination’ (Tsing 2015) that prompted experimentation, care, and new forms of sustenance amid loss, isolation, and precarity. In fermentation microbes transform their substrates and each other into new forms, textures, flavors, aromas, and matters. Practicing fermentation invites open-ended collaboration across species boundaries; requiring attention (when is it ferment and when is it rot?), care (who needs more water, more food, more salt?), and a willingness for all parties to be changed by the process (no one is coming out the same as they went in) (Fournier 2020, Maroney 2018, Villalba 2019).
Fermentation is more than a material process; ideas, people, and movements ferment. The concept offers a rich metaphor that captures the energy of activists, and transformative potential at any scale. Since ferments can also turn sour, go awry, become toxic, and foment violence and trouble, as a metaphor for responsible change, it contains its own limits.
This panel invites participants to ferment as a method in their STS projects. How does thinking with fermentation foreground new configurations of interdependence and care in our work? How might a slower process that allows for unexpected results affect our means of producing knowledge? Might such a method, emergent in the becoming together, open up space to foster ‘good’ relations or challenge ‘bad’ ones?

				This session seeks contributions that use STS and related concepts and frameworks to study the range of efforts to align financial flows with the composition of the atmosphere and its effects on climate. This involves developing climate metrics, translating them to financial terms, and bringing them to bear on investment calculations.
We expect the many mediations between the realms of finance and climate to be sites of contention and uncertainty, providing openings for a range of STS research traditions: the study of metrics, standards, and commensuration; the construction of calculating agents through devices and calculative practices; assetization and commodification of the natural world; risk.
Here’s a partial listing of possible questions:
•	What is left outside the frame when the climate problem is translated to terms of a homogeneous medium of exchange?
•	To what extent are financial practices part of a socio-technical regime that resists change?
•	What processes and actors shape the mediations between the atmosphere’s chemistry and the language of finance?
And an equally partial listing of empirical objects that could fit comfortably within the session:
•	Renewable energy finance – techniques for mobilizing investment in renewable energy.
•	Climate risk measurement and disclosure – efforts to require firms to measure their exposure to climate risk and to disclose that risk.
•	Devaluation of fossil reserves – how fossil fuel producers devalue the volume and value of their reserves.
•	Climate finance technologies and devices – “Climate fintech” – analytic products and platforms and how they make a financial world that reflects climate impacts
•	Development, rating, verification, and valuation of carbon-free and ESG financial products. ",87,finance, climate, risk, valuation,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Economics, Markets, Value/Valuation",Energy and Extraction,Environmental/Multispecies Studies

				In its imagined and actual dimensions, the fourth industrial revolution blurs the lines between the physical, the digital and the biological. This panel explores the ways in which bodies, identities and relations exceed the confines of the digital – non-digital binary and how relations are made (im)possible in their excess. What happens when we force organic matter(s) into digital molds and models? How does the excess interact with the frame, and how can flesh and bodies – individual and collective – reactivate claims of sovereignty and rights in world that is, despite utopian claims, more-than-digital?
       We approach digitalization as a recolonization of thought and practice, and ask how might we grasp these relations at a time when the deconstruction of epistemological binaries is well underway? The digital here refers to the pervasive global and historically specific movement to reform basic societal relations and functions, such as economic transactions, healthcare, welfare services, the provision of basic physical resources (e.g. water and electricity), security, and the negotiation of social identities through AI and automation. Despite the utopian promise of better services and care for all through digitalization, these technologies seem only to amplify the gap between those who enjoy care and those who suffer neglect.
We invite papers that, through STS approaches and practices, make room for relations otherwise by taking digital logics seriously as empirical objects in which more-than-digital relations unfold in and spill over their digital confines.

				How care manifests (or not) in everyday encounters with food and practices of eating in? How to nourish relations of care while nourishing the bodies? Studies from STS, food anthropology, and sociology present a variety of accounts of food-induced socialites and socio-material relations (production challenges, security and environmental change, boundaries between the eater and the eaten, digitalisation and platformization of food, etc). This panel attends to the mundane and everyday instances of relating to, with and through eating. Mundane encounters with food manifest social class, gendered work division, colonial attitudes, socio-economic inequalities, and the moral balance between health and pleasure. Responsibilization of eating and cooking transforms the kitchen and the dining table into a boundary terrain for public health campaigns, environmental concerns, and hedonistic searches for pleasure. This panel asks what is or can be neglected as we care for what and how we eat? Especially as sanitary regimes of lockdowns, confinements, and curfews forefront eating in and intensify invisible work. We invite multidisciplinary works which tackle eating as a learned, trained, proceduralized, and performed practice shaping relations to science, governance, health, pleasure, solidarity, and care. We welcome attention to the embodied aspect of eating and cooking, including interactions with products, elements, instruments, and technology. Following food studies scholars, submissions may be analytically focused on three points and their interrelations: social occasions, food selections, and processes of body incorporation. Finally, we are curious about methodological and speculative reflections on the transformative side of research into the practices of eating.

				The term “forensics” derives from the Latin word “forensis” meaning “belonging to the forum, market (place)”. The etymology recalls that court proceedings and investigations are public affairs and so they were often conducted on the Forum in ancient Rome.
Following this line of thought, several STS works have depicted how experts present forensic findings in the courtroom, explain their evidence and put them up for evaluation. Recent papers have then turned to the epistemic foundations of forensic science. In our panel we want to take up these discussions and push them in a new direction. For while the relationship between forensics and law is already well studied, the intersections of forensics and the society/public, forensics and basic science, and forensics and the police have hardly been explored so far. We propose to take a closer look at these relations by using the example of forensic devices. By forensic devices we do not only mean machines and tools, but also databases, information technologies, and procedures guiding forensic practices. We are looking for studies dedicated to the social life of forensic devices, to their role as mediators or boundary objects between different areas and fields of practice, as well as the public debate about their trustworthiness, risks and chances. We particularly encourage contributions focussing on how these devices help their users to navigate the gap between – and the quest for loyalty to – the realm of investigation on the one hand and the realm of science on the other.

				Forensic evidence is collected, analysed and rendered meaningful by different actors using various technologies and expertise.  A powerful resource in the investigation of crime, STS scholars have paid substantial attention to the development, standardisation, enactment and use of specific forensic technologies (namely fingerprinting and forensic DNA profiling).  These accounts demonstrate the complex expertise and labour involved in producing and using forensic evidence, and the many local and national contexts that impact on how the legitimacy and value of specific types of forensic evidence are negotiated over time.
Beyond fingerprinting and DNA, there are many other types of forensic evidence.  Some have long histories, like fibre analysis.  Others, such as digital forensics, are newer and continually evolving, keeping pace and responding to the latest technological developments.  In this panel, we invite papers that examine empirically the varied actors, labour and expertise involved in the production and use of other types of forensic evidence in the investigation and prosecution of crime.  We are particularly interested in accounts that engage with how forensic evidence and expertise are negotiated in specific local, national and/or global law enforcement contexts and the related areas of overlap and convergence.  
This panel contributes to STS scholarship on the intersections between science, law and law enforcement, standardisation in scientific practice, and the negotiation of expertise across the different epistemic cultures of criminal justice systems.

				The global food system is clearly unsustainable and the COVID-19 crisis has revealed the inequities that have resulted from the concentration of capital, land, technology and the power of a few to set the standards that everyone else must follow. In the shadow of a much politicized global food system, local and regional food systems have long been emerging where the relationships between producers, consumers and intermediaries are working to rebalance power and build solidarity in a diversity of ways. Shifts in the assigned “roles” of actors for different types of work in the food system, the emergence of hybrid actors, the reprioritization of different knowledges that are meant to drive innovation, the diversion of material and knowledge infrastructures, the co-creation of new accountability mechanisms and innovations in the institutions that govern the production, transformation and consumption of food offer important sites for understanding how global inequities and neoliberal dominance are being challenged across scales of action. We invite papers that critically address the methods, metrics and practices that maintain oppressions within food systems. We are particularly interested in understanding how insights from STS and legal theories of responsibility are being reimagined through innovation processes and social movement activism. For example, we would like to explore and confront how relations between actors are being reimagined and practiced across environmental justice, responsible innovation, diverse economies and agroecology movements. Who becomes responsible for reshaping food systems, what are they responsible for and to whom are they accountable?

From Hard Case to Fringe Interest: Mathematics and the Sociology of Science Reconsidered,"Michael J Barany, University of Edinburgh",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Posted: January 27, 2021

				There was a time not so long ago when mathematics was considered the hard case in the sociology of science, the ultimate test of social accounts of certainty, conviction, and the production of universality and self-evidence. David Bloor, with just a pinch of hyperbole, in 1976 called mathematics “the most stubborn of all obstacles to the sociology of knowledge … the holy of holies.” Notwithstanding the surge of interest in data, quantification, and algorithms in recent studies of science and technology, mathematics and mathematicians as such are hard to find in recent conference programs and research agendas in the field. The comparative waning of mathematics in the sociology of science has contrasted with a resurgent interest in social studies of practice in the philosophy of mathematics and an efflorescence of work on mathematics, identity, inequality, and social justice in education research. This Open Panel invites STS scholars with an interest in mathematics and mathematicians to rearticulate why (or whether?) mathematics continues (or ought?) to matter to the sociology of science, to explore whether recent reconsiderations of mathematics can offer new hard cases to the field, and to account for the changing meaning of mathematics in the critical study of knowledge and practice.

				From rational actors to addicted users, Eurocentric theories of mind and society inform the design of AI/ML systems, both explicitly and through uninterrogated universalising norms and assumptions. Scholarly work has examined the societal impacts of AI systems, but less has been done to examine the assumptions of the social that inform such systems. 
This panel explores a genealogy of the human in the machine, examining AI systems as a palimpsest of conceptions of mind and society inherited from the fields that feed into AI research including cognitive science, behavioural psychology, economics, and philosophy. We seek to tease apart the models and paradigms of the human that are translated into code, used to act on, navigate, categorise and govern the world. 
Hubert Dreyfus famously drew on phenomenology to challenge the rationalist assumptions of human intelligence underlying AI research. “Facts and rules”-based theories of intelligence have given way to a neural network paradigm, responding in part to Dreyfus’ challenge. Yet the question of what notions of the human are entangled in AI systems remains–calling us to examine not only conceptions of human intelligence–but also human bodies and human social structures.
We invite papers examining how paradigms of mind and society are explicitly encoded, invisibly inscribed, and entirely omitted from AI/ML design and exploring the consequences of these encodings and erasures. 
We are particularly interested in work exploring AI systems as situated in racial capitalism and colonialism and the racialised and gendered dimension of the human as encoded in AI systems.

				In a world where public finances and political commitments are dwindling (a situation that is being further exacerbated by the current pandemic), states and multilateral agencies consider corporate investment necessary for global health futures. Healthcare, in turn, is seen as an investment opportunity. This has led to a diverse array of private actors in the healthcare sector: from corporate hospitals to insurance companies; from philanthrocapitalist ventures to social enterprises. Common aspirations are the transformation of the social sector through technological innovation, privatization, financialization, digitalization, or entrepreneurship. 
There are discordant scholarly views on the effects of this interplay of state and market. While some authors argue that public goods and progressive aspirations –for health for all, poverty alleviation, or social protection – have become coopted and firmly rooted in the structures and values of 21st century capitalism, other scholars focus on continuities rather than ruptures. In this panel, we aim to think through and beyond this problem space. How can we approach current developments in the health sector other than offering a critique of the neoliberal infiltration of global health (Keshavjee) or reinterpreting the process as another form of social protection?
We are particularly interested in understanding what animates these projects and programmes – beyond the profit motive. What are dominant values and visions that converge around the notion of a social good? What specific visions of the social good are produced and how do they unfold in concrete situations? And how do these visions shape social service provision and global health futures?

				STS has a strong legacy of studying and contributing to discussions on the relationship between science, law/court and governance. To further extend this legacy this open panel welcome contributions that explore the intersection of multiple forms of citizen science, law and environmental governance.
In some countries, the use of data from citizen observations in national environmental law and governance is an established practice. To implement official government environmental policies through different laws at hand is recognised to require observations beyond what public authorities and science can produce on their own. Thus, in some contexts “good relations” exist between citizens, legal frameworks and environmental governance, in others this is not the case. These different relations, good or bad, their contexts and practices are seldom studied and compared in terms of national and international legal frameworks.
Citizen science should here be considered in its broadest sense, including initiatives from science or public authorities as well as from indigenous groups, marginalized or community-based civic mobilization and environmental activism.
Thus, we would like to explore the wider landscape of where environmental citizen science meets legal frameworks and welcome original contributions on environmental justice work (citizen science for compliance), citizen science data leveraged to challenge industry reported data,  citizen observations to motivate or force public authorities studies, nuisance reports holding up in court, but also studies of established practices of implementing national or international legal frameworks on environmental issues through citizen science.

Too often technical experts and government officials have seen the management and disposition of (nuclear) waste as a problem to be solved by experts, with the solution then “sold” to the broader public through techniques of public relations that are often so transparently manipulative as to be self-undermining.  
Instead of seeing waste management and disposition as narrowly technical problems to be resolved through techniques of quantitative risk assessment and cost-benefit analysis, they should be reframed as “wicked problems” (Churchman 1967, Rittel and Webber 1973) with the potential to disrupt good relations across a number of sociotechnical planes: between neighbors; between indigenous and settler populations; between corporations and local communities; between scientists and the public; and between state and society.  Is it possible to solve these problems without toxic social consequences?
For this panel, we call on colleagues to draw on STS and the knowledge of its multiple ancillary disciplines to imagine sociotechnical processes that could build good social, political, and environmental relations.  This might involve critique of existing processes, reportage of innovative improvements, or advocacy of novel processes.  It will surely involve multi-perspectival visioning.  Our primary interest is in nuclear waste, but we will entertain proposed papers on other waste forms as well.

				Governments and the private sector across the world, and increasingly in the global South, are investing both effort and money to build digital infrastructures to enable the adoption of the ostensible technological panacea that is the “smart city.” Smart cities have the potential to utilize digital infrastructure and data to improve service provision, monitor development and even mitigate carbon emissions. However, ‘good relations’ and frameworks of responsibility and solidarity around the transitions to digital governance and technocratic decision-making need to be better understood. This is especially for cities in the global South which face actue issues of marginalization and data-driven inequities.
This panel will focus on how “smart cities” are reshaping relations between public institutions, the private sector and urban residents with the potential to marginalize, silence or disadvantage communities in the face of new political-economic nexuses. We welcome empirical, theoretical and methodological papers that address questions including, but not limited to:
-What imaginaries are currently being represented in the frameworks of the “smart city”?
-How might the datafication of cities change geographies of power in urban spaces?
-What is the role of the private sector in provision of ‘public’ digital infrastructures in smart cities and what are its implications for urban governance?
-What role does ‘data-driven governance’ play in altering access and civic engagement, especially for the most marginalized?

				Format: Open Panel 
The governance of emerging technologies exceeds the boundaries of national governments and corporations. Actors and organizations of all types engage in relationships that constantly shape the development of novel technologies. Some organizations operate at the boundaries of policy and science and are usually composed of networks that connect actors and other organizations across different scales (local, regional, and global) to further common goals and agendas. This panel aims to explore the more or less unequal distributions of power in two types of networks: a) networks that facilitate the development of public interest technologies, b) networks that focus on the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Public interest technologies are technological applications explicitly designed to affect public sector goals (public health; conservation, etc). SDGs advance sustainability goals in dimensions such as ending poverty, improving health, and preserving the natural environment. Surrounding networks thus wrestle with visions of the public good as well as with innovation narratives, structures of power, and organizational culture. We are interested in understanding how different network configurations and power distributions overcome a variety of challenges, such as scarcity of resources, conflicts of interests, and others. We propose an examination of the structures of power and inequality within and across these networks as well as the implications for human health and the environment.

				Inequalities and (in)justices have taken center stage in discussions about the global ecological crisis.  The effects of vector-borne diseases increasing health inequalities, the rise of social movements fighting for social and racial equity, and the uneven socio-physical and intellectual realities of the Anthropocene have renewed questions about how scholars and practitioners conceptualize and enact notions of agency and power in the study, practice, and governance of environmental conflicts. 
Today, many agree that ecological change disproportionately impacts communities across class, race, gender, species, and ecosystems. However, the complex mechanisms by which these inequalities arise, the multiple agencies and power relations that enable these disparities, and their long-lasting effects across species are still under-theorized and under-historized. Furthermore, the challenge to compellingly address human and non-human agencies remains across realms of social activism and academic thinking—particularly in contexts where accounts on non-human agencies seem divorced from pressing social justice agendas. 
This panel invites discussions that incorporate underrepresented agents (e.g., indigenous peoples, future generations, sexual and gender minorities, grassroots organizations) and non-humans (e.g., chemical forms, technologies, animals, and ecosystems) into a broader understanding of agency and power in the study and governance of environmental conflicts. It welcomes approaches from research to activism and policymaking that unveil new research/action pathways to advance our understanding of how socio-technical-ecological assemblages (re)produce inequalities. It urges attention to methodologies for socio-historical research and activism that address issues of colonialism and violence and that engage with intellectual trajectories and knowledge systems across the so-called Global North and South.

				Salomé Skvirsky (2020) defines the process genre, or “how-to”-ness, as “the sequentially ordered representations of making or doing something.” Moving beyond the question of replicability in experimentation (e.g., Collins 1985), we take inspiration from Skvirsky to invite submissions that explore aesthetic qualities of the how-to genre in knowledge-making practices. Specifically, we want to extend her analysis to scientific and social-scientific manuals. In thinking about objects like field guides, ethnographic textbooks, ecological surveys, personal research journals, archeological codes and conventions, we ask: what kind of affects, attachments and aesthetic experiences are produced and reproduced in the doing of science and through its representation in manuals? Svkirsky focuses on absorption, but we also invite papers that explore other feelings like boredom, love, anxiety, resentment, awe, etc. How are they enabled by the “how-to” genre of the manual? And how does this genre produce, reproduce, and disrupt relations, good or otherwise, between knowledge producers, objects of study, disciplines, institutions, and places? 
The manual is also a genre of theory seen in the exemplar of J. L. Austin’s How to do Things With Words, Bruno Latour’s Science in Action: How to Follow Scientists and Engineers through Society and, to a certain extent, in Kate Brown’s Manual for Survival. We therefore invite submissions that interrogate a “how-to” manual as an object of analysis, but also as a mode of STS analysis and theorization, or, better yet, written in the how-to genre itself!

				Precision agriculture (PA) are assemblages of software and hardware technologies—notably tractors and unmanned aerial vehicles with built-in multi and hyperspectral camera sensors—for data collection, analysis, and control of farm equipment and decision-support systems that recommend farmers about site-specific planting, spraying, and harvesting decisions.  PA is heralded as a “digital revolution” that will allow farming to meet grand challenges of the 21st century, including food security and climate change. However, these technologies also bring along with them several social and ethical costs for networks of agri-food practitioners. For example, PA is rescripting labor and creating new rural subjectivities that reimagines the role of agricultural practitioners and politics of knowledge, and poses questions about the prospects and perils of surveillance capitalism. The social and ethical risks of PA on farming and non-farming communities are not entirely predictable, and by virtue of technology’s newness, have little to no historical precedent. This panel seeks papers that attends to such concerns of digitalization in agriculture. The panel welcomes empirical, theoretical and methodological papers that are intellectually committed to explore the social and political effects of PA through participatory and deliberative approaches that include perspectives of multiple and diverse stakeholders or literatures across local, regional, or global food systems.

				Innovation is a central element within public and private discussions over the form and direction of socio-technical change. However, ‘innovation’ as a topic presents STS scholars with a number of closely-related dilemmas. Is our role to deconstruct and challenge the very idea of innovation or else to seek ways of augmenting and developing it in a more socially-engaged and responsible fashion? Should we view innovation as a source of social and environmental challenges or else as a positive means of addressing those same challenges? Given the fast-expanding literature within Innovation Studies in particular, should STS scholars seek to build intellectual bridges with neighbouring disciplines or else develop more distinctive theoretical and empirical perspectives? Faced with uncertain and unequal worlds, is innovation – and innovation scholarship – part of the problem or the solution?
In this session, we invite contributions from STS scholars whose work addresses the interface between innovation, STS and ‘good relations’: including global issues of inequality and uncertainty. We welcome empirical studies exploring innovation in specific contexts but also those which seek new conceptual possibilities regarding STS and innovation.

","
				
				
				Repeatedly, when medical scientists propose the authorization of new biotechnologies, fears and hopes emerge alongside new impasses, legal frictions, and uncertainties. This applies, for example, to cutting-edge therapies potentially capable of treating chronic diseases and, hence, of substituting pharmaceuticals that are currently in use (sometimes paradigmatically). While navigating between this skepticism towards regulatory authorities and reassurances of faith in science, which biopolitical agendas are enacted and disseminated by the proposed biotechnologies in contemporary health innovation arenas?
This panel aims to explore the impacts of new health technologies on different societies and how, in turn, multiple actors affect new biotechnologies, including their evaluation processes, design and related health policies. The panel invites contributions that address aspects of the development, circulation, and co-regulation of novel biotechnologies as relatable to forms of bionetworking (for instance judicialization, biohacking, infrastructuring, and digital activism). Bionetworking practices comprise collaborative relationships between scientists, patients, their caretakers, and other actors (including biological, legal, and entrepreneurial ones), to support and/or disqualify promising biotechnologies.
In light of this, the panel provides a platform to discuss the actuality and uses of concepts linked to the STS-field of biocitizenship (Petryna 2013, Novas and Rose 2007) like political economies of hope (Novas 2006); life assemblages (Sleeboom-Faulkner 2014); and adoption space (Gardner et al. 2017). It looks to discuss controversies in areas such as vaccinology, regenerative medicine, gene therapy, translational and precision medicine, microbiome-based therapies, and experimental therapies more broadly. A central point of reflection concerns how tensions between different ways of assessing the efficacy and innovativeness of proposed biotechnologies, and of co-producing medical evidence, might become co-constitutive of biosocialities.

				Initiatives to stimulate innovation through “co-creation” among diverse actors are proliferating, whether driven from the top-down through governments and policy instruments (e.g. in living labs, public procurement of innovation and pre-commercial procurement) or bottom-up by business or civil society (e.g. in social innovation). But can and does co-creation (in its multiple configurations) really contribute to democratizing innovation, legitimizing interventions, addressing grand societal challenges, and facilitating sociotechnical transitions? How is co-creation enacted in practice? How do power asymmetries and incumbency shape co-creation outcomes? What are the possibilities and problems of efforts to scale-up co-creation across different locations? And how should we interrogate the practices, rhetoric, and normative implications of of co-creation? 
In this panel, we interrogate the processes, practices, problems, publics and power structures surrounding the inflationary use of “co-creation” as remedy for innovation skepticism and democratic deficits — often combined with effort of up-scaling and replication its processes and results. We welcome empirical cases drawing on a variety of methods, analyses of co-creative practices that build on extant concepts in STS and neighboring fields, and new theoretical and conceptual developments.

				This panel focuses on consequences of technological interruptions in design from STS perspectives, and questions what we lose to these interruptions through feminist lenses. Technology’s disruption of the social has long been a topic in STS. Our panel extends this inquiry into technological interruptions in the practice of design where outcomes impact the social politically and economically. Design is often framed in opposition to craft as mental activity versus embodied activity. In contrast to this false dichotomy, we see design as a craft performing in a network of mind, body, tools, and matter. These sympathetic relationships between mind and hands, hands and tools, tools and matter play creative roles in design processes. It is our position that automated technologies like Building Information Softwares and Digital Fabrication Tools in design interrupt this link. These technologies privilege design as a purely mental activity and disregard the role of embodied activities in the process. Designers who use these technologies are constrained by their knowledge and skills. Additionally, whether intentionally or not, these technologies contain and perpetuate biases that then become part of the design process. What do we lose in creative processes interrupted by automated technologies? What type of biases impact the design process and how do they impact them? How do we frame the creative process of design as a feminist question?

				Recent years have seen an outpouring of work on platforms and platformization. However, scholars in this emerging field confront many kinds of uncertainty. Platforms are notoriously opaque. Often, datasets are proprietary, technologies, black-boxed, and firms’ secrets, guarded by aggressive NDAs. The constitutive reflexivity of platforms–the fact that they bring multiple actors into relation by definition, and use the ways we know them to know us–raises profound questions about positionality and expertise. The very term “platform” is ideological. One uncertainty is whether scholars should center it at all. 
This panel will address the conceptual and practical challenges involved in knowing platforms. Scholars have approached this topic from many disciplinary backgrounds. We invite reflections on the advantages and drawbacks of methods ranging from visiting archives to conducting interviews, participating in social movements to computationally analyzing platform outputs. We seek work that examines (possible) alliances among academics, platforms, and users, as well as journalists, activists, and policymakers, and the power relations that permeate them. Recent controversies have highlighted the power of technology firms to share or withhold data, and harass or fire researchers. At the same time, austerity is shifting power relations within and between the academy and “the public.” Acknowledging the longstanding systems of oppression and exploitation that continue to shape these developments, we especially encourage papers that center the expertise of vulnerable users. We aim to build not only knowledge but community among those who want their research on platforms to advance more just relations in an uncertain world.

				The unprecedented economic crisis resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, the global lockdown, the social distance restrictions, and the sanitary risk have created a breeding ground for an accelerated and unregulated expansion of digital platforms. Big data and artificial intelligence technologies have deepened that path of transformation by automating different spheres of economic, social, and political reproduction around the world. Businesses, workers, and consumers heavily rely on the use of platforms, services, and online work making visible new socio-technical arrangements of the so-called “gig economy.” These new forms of production organization and work management bring opportunities for growth and profit, but also new forms of value extraction and exploitation. Under these conditions, new forms of resistance and organization have emerged in order to bargain the algorithmic labor management methods that companies are implementing. This panel aims to explore the effects of the widespread use of online platforms, algorithm management and other related technologies, and organizational methods in improving or worsening working conditions; and we are also looking for best-practice experiences oriented to the amelioration of working conditions based on fair work principles. The contributions to this panel are open, but are not limited to comparative analysis or case studies of how algorithmic labor management methods impact working conditions; we also seek contributions of how organizations engage on the social bargaining of algorithms, and other social actions aimed at negotiating, reducing, regulating, changing or counteracting those effects of algorithmic management on working conditions.",111,Algorithmic Management, gig economy, fair work, working conditions, digital labour,NA,NA,NA,"Big Data, AI and Machine Learning","Economics, Markets, Value/Valuation",Social Justice/Social Movement

				Goodness is fickle. Goodness is fragile, Martha Nussbaum has argued; and it is potent. Good relations come with agency, legitimacy or care, depending on the moral regime that goodness is inflected in.
This panel explores how moralities shape and are shaped in worlds equipped with a plethora of technologies. The panel focuses on the heterogeneous moralities, brittle and persistent, that animate the mediatized, digitized, and datafied dealings of today.
The panel proceeds from the hypothesis that today’s technicized worlds re-mix and re-configure regimes of goodness and of engagement (Laurent Thévenot). Digital technologies, Noortje Marres notes, may transform the situational fabric of the everyday, synthesizing public and private in novel ways. Web algorithms, e.g., rank postings and invoke users according to distinct logics of valuation (Andreas Birkbak and Hjalmar Bang Carlsen). When myriad practices are coordinated in far-flung assemblages, public justification, organized planning, and intimate care interlock, clash or undermine one another (María Puig de la Bellacasa).
Against this backdrop, the panel tends to the weak, wicked, and poor relations that lack agency, legitimacy, and care. It examines affected non-users and uses (Eric Baumer), bystanders (Susann Wagenknecht), conspirators (Timothy Choy), traitors, trespassers, and intruders—shadowy figures that fail to entertain good relations. Drawing attention to bystanding, treason, coterie, contagion (Adam Kramer, Jamie Guillory, and Jeffrey Hancock), and carelessness, the panel sets out to tackle a range of uneasy techno-moral figurations.

				Men have made significant contributions to each era of the last four centuries of feminist movements. And they have done so in diverse ways, which have been linked to the particular character of each feminist movement—Liberal, Marxist, radical, socialist, women of color, anti-colonial, indigenous, LGBT, and others.  Yet there exists little documentation of how this has occurred in Latin America, in the past or today.  Consequently, there has been little or no attention to men’s identifiably feminist contributions to the Latin American production of knowledge.
What are the distinctive features of men’s Latin American feminisms historically?  Has the persistent production of both practices and stereotypes of machismo obscured at least some Latin American men’s pro-feminist activities? How has the recent increase in women leaders in 4S had effects on men’s 4S feminist thinking?    How have pro-feminist projects by the United Nations and other national and international organizations contributed to men’s feminisms in Latin America?

				Data-driven methods such as machine learning and artificial intelligence and their development for and deployment in a wide variety of social and societal contexts are currently experiencing a critical moment of academic, media and political discussion. This applies not least to the realm of law and legal practice:
With applications such as forecasting court decisions via machine learning algorithms, automated reading, scanning and creation of legal texts, predictability of legal disputes, participatory tools for democratising legal practice comes the promise of innovation within the legal system. However, this innovation is not always welcomed enthusiastically and requires critical inquiry.
An STS perspective is particularly fruitful in this realm when it comes to understanding the implementation dynamics and potential consequences of legal technologies. This open panel invites empirical and theoretical contributions that address the following questions and more:
Which actors discuss legal technologies? 
Who benefits from the envisioned predictive power of machine learning?
In what ways are legal practices and epistemologies shaped and reconceptualised by the application of data-driven methods?
To what extent can legal technologies contribute to rethinking the relations between the individual and the legal apparatus and thereby contribute to “Good Relations”?
Do the conceptual differences between a case-law system and a codified law system play a role in the question of compatibility with Big Data applications?
To what extent is the potential of legal technologies overestimated and/or underestimated?
How can law be rethought in light of data-driven methods?

","
				
				
				This panel centers decolonial, feminist science studies to explore material bodies as infrastructures that alternately stabilize and contest structural inequity. It does so by foregrounding the construction of load-bearing bodies —human and otherwise— suspended amidst the weight and tension of unequal relations. In so doing, we aim to investigate the blurred boundaries of bodies and the structures they entail, especially those of racial capitalism and cisheteropatriarchy. Material burdens settle into bodies, embedding privilege and subjection within capacities and orientations that can be difficult to dislodge. As such, bodies become scalar archives for uneven intra-actions among techno-political, scientific, and ecological processes. From them, we can locate antiblackness and white supremacy in toxicities that sediment into certain beings, but away from others. We can chart geographies of surrogacy from those of imperial plunder. At the same time, attuning to bodily matters can bring alternative possibilities into alignment. Demands to repatriate medical specimens offer fulcrums for indigenous sovereignties. Tracking hormonal indicators can subvert sexed dynasties in religious education.
We seek papers that grapple with the potentialities of load-bearing bodies in relation to durable inequities. We hope to address how bodily burdens maintain disparate conditions, and how bodily stuff can animate good relations for liberatory horizons. We look forward to developing theoretical and methodological conversations across locations and time periods, with particular interest in knotty entanglements of beings, buildings, politics, environments, institutions, infrastructures, and their constituent matters. We hope that an open, hybrid panel will deepen scholarly networks concerned with STS and justice.

				The COVID-19 pandemic and associated logistical blunders have many wondering what could have been done better in terms of planning for, and responding to, a public health emergency. But disaster research has long dealt with the problem of anticipating the unprecedented, and preparing to respond effectively to novel emergencies. What nuances can the 2020 crisis teach STS scholars and students of disasters about “normal accidents,” increasing organizational reliability and resilience, “practical drift,” and epistemic challenges? In what ways are failures in protecting public health applicable (or not) to other realms of anticipating and calculating risks? How might flexible response strategies for future emergencies look like, especially ones that don’t rely on “technical fixes” (or legal fixes, etc.)? Which infrastructures exist, need to be created, might be developed? Who ought to be trained to respond, and how? How can we enhance equity during emergency response? What role might STS expertise play in bringing a comprehensive perspective to the table?
The panel welcomes contributions from scholars studying preparedness and response strategies – be that in public health or energy policy, from the perspective of climate policy or international governance, etc. It invites contributions from organizational, technical, training, and historical perspectives, to mention just a few.

				Over the last decades, higher education and research systems have been characterized by deep changes, due to globalization and marketization, that have dramatically transformed research careers. While doctoral and postdoctoral researchers constitute a fast-growing workforce, their working conditions have become increasingly precarious and their career prospects uncertain. Those processes tend to exacerbate and create new forms of gendered inequalities for Early Career Researchers (ECRs), first and foremost women – that have been magnified by the COVID-19 crisis (Gewin, 2020). Those inequalities are also reinforced by disparities within academia linked to other social determinants, such as origin, race, citizenship, geographic location, socioeconomic status, sexuality, or ability.
The main goal of this panel is thus to explore inequalities faced by ECRs from a gender perspective and to analyze existing and forthcoming possible dialogues between ECRs and stakeholders in the research ecosystem at the systemic level (policy-makers) and the institutional level (senior researchers, academic managers).
Here are some topics we would like to address in the panel :
– How to enforce policies that ensure better career prospects and career development within and outside academia and to assess their effectiveness and impact?
– How to better integrate ECRs and their interests into decision-making bodies?
– How to tackle gender-based violence at the early career stage within academia, and to disrupt current sexist discourses?
– How to introduce an intersectional analysis to research policies to account for a more complex understanding of how inequalities play out at the early career stage?",117,Early Career Researchers, Gender Inequalities, Gender Equality Policies, Policy Implementation,NA,NA,NA,NA,Feminist STS / Queer STS,Governance and Public Policy,Method and Practice

				Science communication and public engagement with science are key mechanisms by which scientific knowledge is mediated, negotiated, and transformed. Over the past decades, STS research has outlined the ways in which science and society are co-produced through public communication activities and catalysed a shift towards dialogue and engagement in science communication practice. More recently, the question of the diverse relations that are performed in such communication have risen to the fore, as well as concerns about the nature of responsible public engagement, public (dis)trust in expertise, the dizzying impacts of social media, and debates about science’s role in public health. For instance, science communication has been crucial during the Covid-19 pandemic. 
This open panel invites paper proposals that analyse such ways that science is represented, transformed, contested or negotiated in public venues. Papers may explore, for instance, science and technology-related activism; science in social media; science in museums; deliberative experiments; popular science writing; science podcasting; sci­art activities; news media; or science comedy. We invite critical analysis of these sites and mechanisms. For example, papers might analyse the relations of publics and knowledges within particular science communication activities; discuss affective or temporal regimes of public engagement; explore how science is communicated to marginalized populations; or otherwise reflect on how STS might contribute to doing science in public in just, generous, and collaborative ways.

				The possibilities of leveraging Big Data through AI-based interventions are often poised to flow as innovations emerging from the Global North as the active center to the Global South as the passive periphery. Problematizing these flows, this panel is oriented towards showcasing that the Global South is neither a passive recipient, nor is it the periphery of these innovations. The panel invites submissions that identify new and/or reinterpret old concepts and keywords that underlie the emerging meaning(s) and future(s) of AI in the Global South. The range of conversations on this topic operates on a wide spectrum between optimism of leapfrogging and digital transformation of societies on one end and the pessimism of human suffering caused by new forms of data capitalism and colonialism on the other. Mapping this spectrum, the members of this panel will not only present their concepts, keywords, research methods, and case studies in understanding the building and consequences of these technologies, but also collaboratively engage with each other in developing a broader conceptual vocabulary of AI in the Global South. The panel asks what stories of AI are told and shared, what unequal and uncertain world(s) do these stories build, what hopes and concerns do they amplify, and what future(s) do they imagine in the Global South. After all, the concepts and keywords to describe the mutual shaping of AI and society have different intellectual trajectories in different parts of the world. Recognizing this difference is the first step towards understanding it.

				STS scholars have long been interested in the diverse devices that equip markets, from market infrastructures to mundane marketing tools such as shopping carts, knowledge devices, and measuring instruments. As markets are digitized, consumer records, scoring and targeting instruments, trading machines, and so on are key to how markets operate. Data act as a versatile, yet vital, apparatus for markets, playing crucial roles in the form of devices, valuation tools, infrastructures, and assets. 
This panel will explore these various facets of data, and how they help to bring markets into being.
We welcome empirical and theoretical investigations of markets as data. First, with big data technologies, marketing knowledge is increasingly produced from the analysis of large databases that combine heterogeneous arrays of information on consumers, products, firms, and market operations. These data are then stabilized through metrics, dashboards and standards. How do these new “data objects” and knowledge devices reconfigure practices? Second, data streams are fueling automation or decision-making systems: matching algorithms, trade desks, recommendation engines, smart contracts, market screening mechanisms, dashboards. How does automation reconfigure firms’ practices in markets? Third, data are increasingly marketized themselves, harvested from public-facing services such as social media. How do markets for data impact “conventional” markets? Finally, data practices are increasingly subject to specific governance that is often the object of fierce contestation: from regulation such as GDPR in Europe, industry-level self-regulation and labelling processes, to local framing within firms. How does the governance of data, and its contestation shape markets and marketization practices?

				In their edited volume Modes of Uncertainty (2015), Paul Rabinow and Limor Samimian-Darash (2015) propose that risk analysis has become “inadequate in the face of many contemporary problems” and that “uncertainty” is the new central problem in contemporary anthropological thought and practice. In these pandemic times, also marked by climate hazards, environmental destruction, dispossessions, political collapse, uncertainties surround us and burden us with ever greater force. 
For this panel, we invite contributions that reflect on the changing conditions and principles of scientific knowledge practices that hold on to values of objectivity, probability, reproducibility, standardization, replicability, and mass production. We aim to work through a set of questions that transform this apparent paradox: futures are scripted as uncertain, but at the same time, political and economic strategies and scientific formations remain set on replicable methodologies and mass productions. We ask ourselves: What if the product, the process, the tool, the method, the consumer good, or the design to be replicated is not yet complete, permanent, and accomplished? What if it is uncertain? How can one replicate methods, tools, objects that have an unfinished and uncertain future? How can we make and maintain a production line of replicability over time, with inherent failures, with shifts and turns? 
We aim for contributions that address the paradox of uncertain, underdetermined futures and standardized, overdetermined knowledge practices.

Measurement and Commensuration in Professions,"Alexandra Vinson, University of Michigan","Kelly Underman, Drexel University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Posted: January 27, 2021

				Quantification and commensuration have been major areas of inquiry in STS in recent years (Mennicken & Espeland 2019). STS work has highlighted the challenges of measuring the attributes or performance of individuals and of ensuring these measurements are comparable. While regulation and control through tracking has long been a feature of low-wage work, these new forms of quantification and commensuration are increasingly prevalent in high-status professional groups like physicians and nurses. Such forms of quantification and commensuration are often aimed at increasing productivity, agility, and well-being among professionals and occupational workers (Lupton, 2016; Till, 2019). They can also be used to assess, quantify and compare knowledge, skills, personal attributes, and emotional states (Stark, 2020), with the hope that developing measurements and quantifications will offer an alternative to traditional forms of evaluation, and that this might reduce bias in skill assessments.
In this panel we seek to explore how quantification and commensuration are remaking professional groups and identities, and how new quantification technologies may play a role in professionalizing projects. These technologies may take the shape of formal evaluations and tests, supportive tools for formative development, tracking apps for wellness, and other profession- or workplace-sponsored programs that promote the collection, quantification, and commensuration of working professionals’ activity. We also welcome proposals focusing on assessment in practice, the development of assessments and measures, the history of assessment approaches, and other related topics.

				Risk has always been environmental. Its origins are in maritime insurance, providing a bulwark against potential losses from travel through stormy seas. Today, statistics and probability mediate our definitions of environmental extremes, abnormal events, and the thresholds at which they occur for phenomena such as global warming and its resultant impacts. If, as Ulrich Beck argued, we are living in a risk society, then in the era of the Anthropocene, this entails an acute awareness of environmental risks.
Media are privileged tools through which to represent and understand environmental risk, including discourses of peak oil, carbon budgets, and viral projects like the climate clock in New York City. From scenario planning to speculative countdowns, mediations of risk “make predictable and manage the production of affects like anxiety, fear, and even shock” (Neves 2020, 349). Confronting a moment of radical environmental uncertainty, this panel asks, how do measurements, models and other media shape and control the material risks associated with environmental change? How might we conceptualize the relationship between environmental risk, uncertainty, probability theory, and its history?”
Finally, we cannot ignore the role of a risk society in creating environmental crises, as the depletion economies built around speculative capital produce both social inequalities and environmental precarity. We encourage prospective panelists to consider issues of environmental and social justice: what constitutes “good relations” when it comes to living with environmental risk? What kind of role can STS play in providing us with just, affirmative, and decolonial visions for environmental citizenship?

				Hormonal bodies have always been technologies of socio-technical relations. From the practices of spatial segregation due to menstruation (Spain, 1993) to the physical effects of ovulation and bleeding, to the varied practice of tracking of menstruation and ovulation (Delaney, Lupton, Toth, 1988, p. 274), scholars in feminist technoscience have documented menstruation as propelling and troubling gendered social formations. 
Simultaneously, social, political, and technical designs of (bio)technologies have influenced and co-constructed the meanings and embodied experiences of menstruation. Entrepreneurs have introduced products and services designed to meet the perceived needs of menstruators and appeal to neoliberal notions of ‘health and wellbeing’ (e.g., period panties, organic tampon subscriptions). Pharmaceutical companies, chemical products, and medical practitioners have developed, marketed, and prescribed products which manage, alter and disrupt endocrine cycles, troubling natural conceptions of menstruation. Social technologies like Instagram and TikTok have provided menstrual activists spaces to destigmatize menses, work to end period poverty (being unable to afford products to manage menstrual bleeding), and challenge assumptions and discursive constructions about difference and menstruation (Hasson, 2016). 
Ruha Benjamin’s work on race after technology suggests interdependency is always happening. “Our lived realit[ies] and infrastructural designs connect us in seen and unseen ways” (2019, p. 194). This panel takes up the premise of interdependency in considering technologies of menstruation and their effects. As precariously situated critical scholars, we invite scholars committed to feminist studies of technoscience and embodiment to inclusively and generatively engage in questions of the co-shaping of knowledge about menstruation with us.

				The construction of expertise is a key topic within STS, as is disagreement amongst experts (Shapin 1994; Collins & Evans 2002; Jasanoff 2009; Collins et al. 2020). Yet, categorising expert knowledge remains a problem. Formulations in terms of fields, disciplines, or domains come from an outside, “meta” position that sits uneasily with STS’s insights on the co-construction of scientific facts and social authority.
STS itself has been described as such an interdisciplinary endeavor with methodologies and theoretical frameworks that can be applied to different domains (Jasanoff 2016). The past decade has seen efforts to develop new forms of “domain-general” expertise such as metascience and data science (Evans & Foster 2011; Ioannidis et al. 2015; Munafò et al. 2017; Strasser & Edwards 2017; Ribes et al. 2019). These have different motivations and intervene in specific fields in different ways—as interlocutors, partners, and, even, diagnosticians. Often, different forms of expertise establish distinct epistemic cultures in order to protect their autonomy and avoid the open conflicts that reveal rival epistemological commitments (Knorr Cetina 1999). However, interactions between domain-general and domain-specific forms of expertise have produced new conflicts (Leonelli 2016; Peterson & Panosfky 2020).
This raises challenging questions. Does the incursion of domain-general expertise represent a threat to the autonomy of disciplinary scientists? What would ‘good relations’ across this divide look like? How are domain-specific skills like embodied knowledge and practical judgment absorbed into domain-general systems meant to enumerate, evaluate, or automate scientific practice? How should these new “sciences of science” make STS scholars rethink their own expertise, motivations, and roles in discussions of policy?
We welcome papers on topics including the evaluation of science, data-driven science policy, data-centric approaches to scientific research, automation in science, as well as other papers looking at how scientific expertise is being turned on epistemic cultures.

				The aim of the panel is to revisit concerns raised by Warwick Anderson (2009) about what he perceived to be the “minor postcolonial agenda in STS” becoming subsumed “as scholars choose now to fetishize ‘globalisation’.” At the time, as Maureen McNeil (2005: 106, 111) observed, the term “postcolonial” was “a rather ambiguous term” touching on “both the impact and legacies of formally deposed imperial regimes and to new forms of exploitative global relations,” noting that “colonial legacies are never simply ‘leftover’ from the past, they are reanimated, recast and reappropriated in new forms and new ways, with new resistances.” Anderson (2009: 389-390), in turn, described two overlapping directions within postcolonial STS: one was concerned with “subjugated knowledges” and the other with “conjugated subjects.” The critical study of subjugated knowledges placed emphasis on understandings of power, history, identity, and epistemology that have been marginalised or made invisible within Western society (e.g., Palladino and Worboys, 1993; Visvanathan, 1997; Harding, 1998). Conjugated subjects, on the other hand, “hint[ed] at postcolonial hybridity and heterogeneity, suggesting a more complicated and entangled state of affairs, one requiring intimate engagement with various theoretical stances popular in the humanities at the turn of the last century.” This raised doubt about the comprehensiveness and efficacy of prevailing narratives in which social, cultural, and political formations of technoscientific imperialism are depicted as one-way relationships of “sending” colonisers and “receiving” colonial subjects (e.g., Watson-Verran and Turnbull, 1995; Abraham, 2006; Seth, 2009). Moreover, it established grounds for a challenge to what Anderson (2009: 392, 397) described as global claims about patterns of local transactions that seem “quite abstract, strangely depopulated, and depleted of historical and social content” brought into being by a “[r]eluctance to recognise and engage directly with the postcolonial spectre haunting globalisation.” Studying what have since been called, variously, “connected,” “shared,” and “entangled” histories of technoscientific co-production permit, we believe, a foretaste of what can be achieved by untangling and reconnecting local histories of technoscience in ways that stress processes of mutual influencing across borders (cf. Philip, Irani, and Dourish, 2012; Kowal, Radin, and Reardon, 2013; Brandt, 2014). Accordingly, we solicit papers that include (but are not limited to) studies of “connected,” “shared,” and “entangled” relationships of technoscience that:
 have occurred between colonial powers and colonized peoples
 have occurred under (pre- or post-1989) first-second-third world international relationships
 have occurred in so-called developing/developed nation relationships
 have occurred as a result of collaborations in international technoscientific projects (e.g., Human Genome Projects, Millennium Seed Bank Partnership)

				This panel invites papers that deepen understandings of the histories, cultures, and politics of cybernetics. Since the mid-twentieth century, cybernetics has exercised a profound influence on contemporary science, technology, and society. Its historical development and impacts have received significant recent attention, which has shown how cybernetics emerged to shape not only the technological infrastructures and politics of the present day, but also the intellectual, ethical, and trajectories of disciplines across the natural and social sciences and engineering. 
While the importance of cybernetics is widely recognized, the stories told about it are largely situated within post-World War II Euro-American contexts and focused on a recognized group of influential figures and institutions. In recent years, there has been a movement to move beyond these foundations the seek a better grasp of how cybernetics has travelled, translated, and diversified into many forms across disciplines, but also across countries. This panel will join this movement, inviting contributions that push beyond dominant framings of cybernetics in order to examine it in ways that are multiple, especially transnationally and transdisciplinarily. 
The panel invites scholars interested in thinking of cybernetics as multiple, diverse in its origins, forms, and effects, with the goal of beginning a collective discussion about the foundations and futures of cybernetics and information societies broadly. Papers may address: histories of cybernetics beyond Euro-American contexts; cybernetics’ interactions with other disciplines, including but not limited to economics, education, management, cognitive sciences, life sciences, ethics and philosophy; and cybernetics in popular culture.

				Lots of debates have recently arised about an alleged crisis of trust in science. Scientific knowledge is increasingly  entangled in crossed accusations of ‘fakeness’, conspiracy and falsification, on a number of critical issues (vaccines, pollution, climate, etc.). To make sense of this somewhat blurry picture, this panel argues for the necessity to go back to the basics of STS, adopting a symmetrical approach of contemporary contestations of science. This way, we wish to depict a large continuum of critiques, mobilizations and material resources at play in the transformation of the way we collectively apprehend the scientific truth. Contributions could follow three lines of research:
(1) by analyzing the material practices of so-called alternative science: how do climate skeptics or anti-vaxxers (for instance) collect data, design experiments, publicize results supporting their marginated theories?
(2) by documenting how corporate actors strive to undermine scientific consensus in order to defend their interests (building networks of journals, think tanks, philanthropic organizations, etc.) and/or how scientific institutions deal with such corporate involvement in knowledge production;
(3) by investigating the mobilization of heterogeneous actors (scientists, journalists, physicians) to fight what they consider irrational attacks against reason and progress. What kind of strategies, arguments and alliances do they build to “debunk fake science”?
We welcome a variety of cases and methods, in particular analyses focusing on the Global South (with different epistemic traditions & non-hegemonic scientific production), and/or using digital methods.

Nonhuman Phenomenology and Technoscientific Intersubjectivity,"Claire Webb, MIT - Anthropology","Richard Fadok, MIT",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Posted: January 27, 2021

				Vilem Flusser wrote that human knowledge of animal minds must navigate between the “Scylla of anthropocentric arrogance” and the “Charybdis of nostalgie de la boue” (2012). While nonhuman modes of sensing are often athwart to or simply alien from human phenomenologies, technoscientific actors enact enmeshments with such Others in radical forms of relational world-making—for instance, with brittlestars (Barad 2007) and with dogs (Haraway 2008). This panel explores the discourses, values, and practices through which scientists, technologists, and designers speculate on and care about nonhuman modes of sensation. 
Over the past decade, scholars have described how our knowledge of nonhuman phenomenology is mediated by language (Kohn 2013), sentiment (Sharp 2019), gesture (Kalshoven 2018), and care (Wanderer 2018; cf. Candea 2010). Building on this work, we invite panelists to reflect on how the production of knowledge about nonhuman minds informs experimental and technical design and, in turn, how such designs affect the epistemological possibilities of knowing “what it is like to be” nonhuman (see Nagel 1974). How do epistemologies of the senses—the confrontation of the gaze (Derrida 1997), the immersive quality of sound (Roosth 2009), the intimacy of touch (Hayward 2010)—cultivate interspecies knowledge-making?
We welcome papers from a range of theoretical, methodological, and topical perspectives that examine the dialectic of human perception and nonhuman sensibility. Submissions may include empirical studies of the experimental and technical infrastructures through which nonhuman phenomenologies are grasped or theoretical examinations of human-nonhuman intersubjectivity (not just between biological organisms but also with AI and machines).

				Open panel to discuss theories and practices of “nudging” (also referred to as “libertarian paternalism”) as a way to respond to unequal and uncertain worlds. Open panel to function in round robin format between paper presenters, with brief Q&A following each paper and wider discussion to follow all presentations and their corresponding Q&A sessions. Cass R. Sunstein (2014) defines nudges as “liberty-preserving approaches that steer people in particular directions, but that also allow them to go their own way,” and they are “intended to ensure that people do not struggle when they seek to interact with their government or to achieve their goals.” This open panel will address questions of nudging’s efficacy with regard to rationality, ethics, and agency within unequal and uncertain worlds. Can nudging prove to instantiate greater equality and certainty when we most need it, and if so, how? ***Open panel submitter has a paper that is conference ready that describes nudging in the context of transhumanism and material agency, using thinkers such as Bruno Latour, Andy Clark, and Lambros Malafouris.*** ",130,nudging, libertarian paternalism, public policy,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Big Data, AI and Machine Learning","Economics, Markets, Value/Valuation",Governance and Public Policy

				With the popularity of crowd-sourcing, peer production, and the sharing economy, the ideas of open platforms loom large.  Generally, an open platform refers to a technological system operating under a public standard so that applications following the same standard can be functionally integrated.  Standardization has a longstanding history since the Industrial Revolution.  In the 1970s-90s, the deliberations on open systems and protocols fuelled the development of personal computers and the Internet.  When hackers and activists launched the Free and Open Source Software movement in the 1980s-90s, they envisioned the operating systems GNU and Linux as quintessentially open platforms that epitomized the political ideals of freedom, transparency, community, and participation.  By the 2010s-20s, open platforms have gained novel connotations.  To start-ups, open-source environments such as GitHub become popular cyberspace for software development.  To small companies, social media like Facebook provide new opportunities to conduct business and marketing.  Large corporations and governments jump on the bandwagon to support the sustaining and advancing of open-platform software and hardware in operating systems (e.g., Android), telecommunications (e.g., 5G open wifi), and microprocessors (e.g., RISC-V).  In so doing, they nonetheless tread on a thin line between innovation, monopolistic interest, geopolitical competition, intellectual properties, privacy, and security.  In this panel, we try to make sense of these dazzling developments regarding open platforms.  From a global perspective, we examine how they revise the meanings of work, reconfigure the forms of organization, project visions about the future, and engage politics and governance in the digital age.

Optical Media: The Impact of Visual Technologies,"Alexander Monea, George Mason University","Paula Sanchez Nunez de Villavicencio, University of Toronto",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Posted: January 27, 2021
","
				
				
				Optical media, borrowed from Friedrich Kittler, is an expanded concept that connects photography, film and television with other techniques and technologies that mediate optics and vision (e.g. microscopes, telescopes, oscilloscopes, echocardiography, ad inf.). Normalized, expected and often desired, optical media shape how we perceive the reality that surrounds us, mediating our understanding and experience of our inter- and intra-relationships with ourselves, others, objects, and worlds. In so doing, they constitute power relationships that reify inequalities and uncertainties, the key themes of 4S 2021, rendering certain people, places, and things visible, invisible, or hypervisible. These issues have grown in importance in the wake of COVID-19 and social distancing, where optical media have become ubiquitous.
This panel welcomes interdisciplinary research from STS and neighbouring fields that critically examine the role of these embedded and disruptive technologies in guiding our world views and relationships. By paying attention to the modes of seeing and looking that shape our perceptions, behaviours, and practices we can begin to better address their effects on other information systems including but not limited to the ones we work in, socialize in, and reside in. Questions we ask include how are modes of looking shaped by digital optical media? What potentials are there for visual manipulation, exploitation, or psychological vulnerabilities? What new possibilities for ways of thinking, interacting or organizing information do these technologies offer? Who and what is being rendered visible, invisible, or hypervisible and the power politics of optical media?

Pandemic Breathing – Air as Matter of Dis/Connection,"Vanessa Weber, HafenCity University","Lisa Wiedemann, Helmut Schmidt University Hamburg",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Posted: January 27, 2021
","
				
				
				Air is pure complexity: it is full of relations. We share the air with other living beings and every breath is exchange, an entanglement of heterogeneous entities transforming one another. Thus, air is a matter of connection, an interface where humans and other-than-humans, bodies, and the world interfere (cf. Adey 2014, Górska 2016). In times of the covid-19 pandemic air became an element known for its aerosols being capable of passing a virus mouth-to-mouth. However, the pandemic also revealed in an intensified way that ‘[a]ll air is not equal’ (Godfrey & Torres, 2016: 9), since the conditions of respiration are bound to social, spatial, material, political, and economic aspects. The crisis changed our thoughtless relationship with air and made both mi-croscopic connections and disconnections visible.
In this panel we seek to explore air as matter of dis/connection: Which microscopic dis/connections and relations become visible through the air? In which context can we study the politics and sociomateriality of breathing? How can we explore these sociomaterial assemblages of breathing? Which material practices are enacted by pandemic breathing (e.g. filtering, physical distancing)? In which sense do monitoring and data practices reveal the connectivity of air? Does data produce breathable and non-breathable spaces? How do different socio-geographical environments affect breathing? In which respect do bodies, places, buildings, and air data recon-figure one another? Which agentic conflicts, power relations, or inequalities become evident through pandemic breathing?

Politics of data and quantification as modes of governing,"Ville Aula, London School Of Economics & Political Science",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Posted: January 27, 2021
","
				
				
				Techniques and technology have played a major role in the studies of governance ever since the pioneering works of Michel Foucault. Performativity of classification, quantification, and datafication is nowadays a central tenet of a number of fields. STS has showed how politics play out on the level of producing scientific knowledge, governmentality studies have studied the diverse locations of governing, and recent work in critical data studies, data activism, and data justice has shown the political and normative variability of data practices. In addition to this theoretical expansion, material proliferation of digital data forces more practitioners than ever to engage with the politics of data. They must negotiate the competing political pressures of participating in, shaping, and sometimes rejecting digital assemblages. 
Keeping good relations between citizens and data practitioners invites us to address the politics of data and its devices and techniques as a mode of governance. How do practitioners understand and navigate the political dilemmas of contemporary data practices? How do politics unfold, become visible, or remain invisible for practitioners? How are these dilemmas materialized in work, tools, and systems? How should we as researchers relate to such dilemmas? How does, if at all, recent attention to ethics and justice influence practitioner perceptions of data politics? The panel tries to expand STS discussion on data practices by inviting submissions that draw from sociology, political science, and media and communications. The panel welcomes especially empirical papers, but is also open to conceptual, theoretical, and philosophical papers that address data politics.

","
				
				
				In recent years STS scholars have turned toward maintenance and repair as vital but overlooked responsibilities necessitated by our increasingly interconnected world. By foregrounding the banal – even boring – work of maintenance and repair, historians, theorists ethnographers, and others have exposed the constant effort that goes into preserving the functionality of everything from the vast sociotechnical assemblages of interstate highways to small, localized issues of personal comfort and bodily politics raised by air conditioning.
  Yet STS scholars have not yet made serious engagements with the maintenance and repair of cultural media, whose symbolic dimensions are typically left to media studies scholars. While interdisciplinary border crossings between STS and Media have increased, the wholesale digitization of media technologies demands that STS scholars contend with when, how, where, and why cultural media like paintings, radio, film and TV, games, and social media are repaired and maintained. This panel seeks to promote good relations between these two fields, bringing together questions of visibility and invisibility, labor, and innovation central to STS inquiries into repair and maintenance practices with questions of power and communication central to Media Studies. 
Themes to be explored in this panel might include but are not limited to:
1. Preservation and conservation of media artifacts
2. Sociotechnical repair and maintenance in archival collections
3. Digitization and the maintenance of media access
4. Fan and user resistance and repair practices
5. Software maintenance and algorithmic repair
6. Repairing trust and truth in social media

				When talking about good relations with technologies and other-than-humans, as the conference theme does, new social robotics and Artificial Intelligence – or visions of their future version – are the perfect place for inquiry. For our panel, we are looking for talks that explore the relations between humans and their technological alter egos and/or the creation and design of such.
Recently the design and use of robots and AI in a variety of social settings have increased. They range from elaborate chatbots to smart assistants to AI therapists; from care- to companion- to sex robots and more. We are looking for contributions that explore the distinct nature of practices in interaction with those new social technologies. Especially, we want to investigate how these interactions can be kept or turned into “good” relations, against problems such as well-documented biases, racist and sexist premises, ethical concerns, or underlying technology-driven values.
Which knowledges, practices, and methods are helpful in creating, transforming, and studying relations between humans and technological others? Which STS-specific approaches, methods, and theories can help to create good relations?
What visions of the future are (or have been) envisioned in those technologies and how do they shape the future of unequal and uncertain worlds? Are there possible ideas that go beyond techno-dystopias for robotics and AI?

				Biomedical fields increasingly understand life not as genetically determined, but as developing in relation to socio-material experiences. STS has discussed this development as the emergence of a postgenomic era or the biosocial turn, exploring how it changes views on genetics, bodies, their temporality and relationship to environments. For instance, engagements with environmental epigenetics, the microbiome, or viruses, reorient attention towards conceptualising phenomena, such as environment or disease, as relational entities across time and space. Thinking with relationality is an approach we can also find in the philosophy of biology. Dupré (2018, 2020) and others further the notion of process ontology; a theory, which understands biological phenomena as constantly stabilising processes with and in their environments instead of closed entities. While we can observe attempts of biologists themselves to address life as processual in research designs (e.g., applying a life-course perspective), we seek to make a shift in the ontological status of biological thinking more explicit: how does biology come from theory to practice and vice versa?
This panel aims to further discussions on process ontology in STS and to consider how an interdisciplinary processual research agenda could look like in method and practice (Niewöhner/Lock 2018). We invite theoretical works that discuss how process ontology might inform biological theory as well as empirical engagements on how it becomes known experimentally and with what effects for understanding life. We also encourage ethnographic stories that make good relations visible (e.g., symbiotic relationships), contrasting prevailing reductionist accounts on health and disease in biology.

Privately controlled Algorithmic Tools for Evaluation of Publicly Funded Research: Implications for Global STS Communities and Transnational Research Infrastructure,"Leslie Chan, University of Toronto Scarborough","Angela Okune, University of California - Irvine",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Posted: January 27, 2021
","
				
				
				Recent discussions about Transnational STS have pointed out that while academic research is often regarded as “global” and collaborative in nature, there is strong evidence that dominant research evaluation systems based on bibliometrics have historically favoured institutions and research from the global North, while research from the global South is under-represented (Nwagwu 2010). Evaluation systems that favour publications in English and topics thought to be of “international” relevance as opposed to “local” interest have skewed the geographic representation of what is considered “high quality” scholarly work. As Big Data and AI are increasingly integrated into existing systems of research evaluation and university rankings (Chen et al. 2019, Andrews 2020), this panel interrogates the metrics used by and produced through Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools to understand risks and opportunities for facilitating greater diversity of research. 
Importantly, there is also a neglected governance layer to these discussions about AI in research evaluation. Metrics generated by AI are almost exclusively designed and controlled by commercial entities like Elsevier and SpringerNature (Aspesi and Brand 2020). This leads to concern that important decision-making in global research governance is being driven by non-transparent and possibly biased automated processes that are owned and controlled by private entities that are not accountable to researchers and publicly funded institutions. This panel invites submissions that investigate different research governance models that center research communities over AI tools and corporate power. We are interested in learning about individual and institutional attempts to establish community-based governance of data, analytics and metrics. What mechanisms have groups established to attempt to keep processes and infrastructural development safe from corporate capture?

				Emerging technologies and technological promises offer important opportunities to study relationships, networks, and institution building. In recent years the notion of second quantum revolution brought forth the public attention to a new set of technologies being developed under the umbrella term of ‘quantum technology’. New technologies and their accompanying structures present opportunities for profound transformations of the existing hierarchies, institutions, and established norms. In this sense, the emerging quantum sciences are presented as a possible area of contestation for shifting techno-economic relations on the international level. However, major transformations are never contained in the strict bounds of international relations and geopolitics. There have been ongoing efforts of democratization of these technologies, and the public interest has been growing steadily since such devices became accessible through cloud access by IBM.
This panel aims to act as a relational and informational ‘trading zone’ for researchers in quantum ethics, history of quantum technologies, STS researchers in the QT field, and studies on QT that can be utilized by researchers in the STS field. We are looking for both empirical and critical studies focusing on quantum technologies that have a message to spread to the community of researchers. Although QT has a global community of researchers from physics, computer science, and a variety of engineering disciplines, it has always been a highly international and interdisciplinary field where the recent flow of public and private funding (more than 20B€ in the next 10 years) made it a suitable subject of inquiry from the STS perspective.

				This 4S panel welcomes papers around the question of whether international scientific cooperation utilizing racial taxonomies demonstrates the systemic failure of research ethics under the demands of the so-called Global War on Terror and/or War on Crime? After the 9/11 attacks, US, European Union and Chinese security and science agencies expanded the scope of forensic genetic testing to include ancestry, phenotype and lineage estimation. US police usage of forensic genetics and facial recognition systems has been criticized for racial bias. Similar criticism has accompanied European Union funded projects like the Visible Genetic Traits Consortium (VisiGen). China also adopted war on terror rhetoric against separatist movements in Xinjiang. In 2014, in support of the Belt and Road Initiative, President Xi Jinping declared the “Peoples War on Terror” that has led to a cultural genocide, including the mass incarceration of Xinjiang’s Uyghurs and other largely Muslim peoples. Nonetheless, international cooperation on facial recognition and forensic genetic systems aimed at differentiating between Uyghurs and other Indigenous peoples (“minorities”) from Han Chinese settlers continued. Central to international cooperation have been the common shared organizing narratives of scientists acting in the name of the Greater Good or Humanity to develop manhunting technologies to help security forces find criminals, terrorists and/or insurgents. In these shared organizing narratives, visible phenotype traits like skin colour and eye colour and biogeographic ancestry estimates are touted as forms of intelligence that can help guide security forces to identify, track and capture/kill these enemies of civilization and so improve public safety.

Radical Care in Feminist Digital Spaces,"Hara Kouki, University of Crete,

","
				
				
				The increasing digitalization of everyday life reveals a growing activity/presence of feminist practices in the digital sphere (D’Ignazio and Klein 2020; Jarvis 2009; McLean 2020). Such practices reconfigure the digital space and generate more safe, just, inclusive and unoppressive places (Young 1986) that challenge sexist and exclusionary practices. Moreover, in the recent/ongoing pandemic crisis where the digital sphere has augmented, (digital) care practices have gained a distinctive and leading role in people’s everyday lives. Standing against the neoliberal tradition of individualism and commodification, ‘radical care is often connected to positive political change by providing spaces of hope in dark times’ (Hobart and Kneese, 2020: x). In a world overwhelmed by systemic sexism and multiple crises of care, crises of care, such emancipatory possibilities of digital space are bound to play a central role.
This panel shifts attention towards feminist practices of radical care in the digital space and explores their genealogies, characteristics, dynamics, and limitations. We welcome contributions using transdisciplinary and intersectional methods to discuss digital care as related with understandings of inclusion, solidarity and interdependence. How can we theorize a more expanded notion, language and practice of care in the digital space? What would an understanding of radical care mean in relation with data management, digital security and infrastructure?

Re-thinking And Experimenting With Participatory Research Practices And Design Through The Speculative And Ontological Turn,"Peter Danholt, Aarhus University","Alex Wilkie, Goldsmiths, University of London",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Posted: January 27, 2021

				What can design practices, engagement and participation become if we assume multiple ontologies, radical difference and pluralism? What happens, for instance, if established conceptions and rationalities of design and participatory research practices are exposed to a multinaturalist Amerindian ontology that implies that those with whom we study and engage see the world in the same way as we do only from different bodies? (de Castro, 1998; 2004) So, instead of inhabiting the same world, but having multiple cultures, we inhabit different worlds, but have the same culture. So, for instance in such an ontology what the designer, may see as a technological tool to aid the practice, may for the practice not be a tool, but a work load. Multinaturalism implies that we cannot take for granted a shared world and this entail that we must work harder practically and conceptually to come to inhabit the ontology of the other – and potentially invent and construct common worlds.  
In accordance with the speculative and ontological turn(s), this session invites papers that speculate and experiment with such ideas and consider the consequences for design and participatory research practices (Heywood, n.d.; Jensen, 2010; Martin & Heil, 1999; Mol, 2002; Pickering, 2017; Wilkie et al., 2017). The overall ambition with such speculations and experiments is to explore and enable thinking, researching and acting differently: the care for the possible this entails and the commitment to taking seriously the production of existence and knowledges that might take place as part of participatory research practices.
The ontological and speculative turn entails the appreciation of worlds as constructed through interwoven material and conceptual practices and implies the dissolution of both nature/culture and cognitive/material oppositions. The work of Marilyn Strathern, Eduardo Viveiros de Castro, Bruno Latour, Annemarie Mol and Isabelle Stengers is central to the ontological turn and has proposed concepts such as dividualism, praxiography and multinaturalism (ibid). According to de Castro the ontological turn defamiliarizes and de-colonialises modernist and western ontological presumptions about nature-culture, human-non-human divisions. And as both de Castro and Jon Bialecki argue the ontological turn should not be taken – as some might read it – as a critique of one failed ontology (the western) and its replacement with another (say an ontology of sociomaterial interwovenness), since this would just be yet another modernist move. The point is, rather, and in line in with Deleuze and Guattari’s (1987: 28) empirical transcendentalism, to “overthrow ontology” altogether.

				Inspired by the cinema industry and science-fiction writers, Virtual Reality (VR) has been developing since the 1960s in several domains such as design, army, game design, education and is now largely used in medicine, from advanced surgery to mental healthcare. Depending on its application, VR comes in many forms. Typically a virtual helmet allows visual access to a virtual environment and is equipped with captors to replicate instantaneously the movements of the body. VR can be used for testing military scenarios, designing prototypes, training surgeons before operations, or treating phobias by virtually confronting patients with their fears.
VR can be used to replay situations in the past as well as to anticipate situations. Its tools are sought after to train and treat people in a standardized but also personalized way, at a minor cost. But its development raises numerous social, ethical, and ontological issues. Among them: What does the hybrid status of reality in the virtual world do to the conception of the situations where it is implemented? How does VR impact work processes and relationships? How do professionals (be they doctors, game designers, soldiers, etc.) use it to explore new ways of approaching performances? How does VR convey hopes and challenges specific to each context? How do this technology and the implemented scenarios reproduce unequal categories and worldviews? 
This panel aims to gather research that tackles these non-exhaustive questions, in order to understand the forms and consequences of the development of virtual reality technologies in various contexts.

				Developments in machine learning in healthcare led to hopeful expressions regarding tailored care, early risk detection and information integration but come with ethical concerns as well. Solutions are predominantly sought in ethical principles (e.g. ‘fair’, ‘responsible’, ‘transparent’ or ‘trustworthy’ data analytics), technical fixes (e.g. synthetic data) and regulatory frameworks (e.g. the GDPR). While laudable, this focus also comes with limitations: it ignores the implicit norms, routines and values already present within particular healthcare practices and it may lead to adverse effects, e.g. layering of multiple, conflicting rules that obfuscate healthcare work and increased regulatory pressure that reduces spaces to provide good care.
This panel explores the benefits of a shift in perspective from suitable legal-ethical frameworks and principles for machine learning in healthcare towards an ethnographic approach that studies ethics-in-practice and responsibility-in-the-making, centering on:
1.Responsible knowledge practices: how do machine learning initiatives reconfigure responsible knowledge practices in various healthcare domains?
2.Ethical work in situ: how are ethical decisions made within the mundane work of health practitioners, data scientists and other stakeholders (such as patient groups) in machine learning initiatives?
3.From rules to resilience: how can we make machine learning initiatives in healthcare more resilient? Instead of fixing responsibilities in rules, how can we explore the ‘texture’ of responsible data-driven healthcare in practice? 
In spirit of the conference theme, we particularly welcome studies that find new ways of producing ‘good relations’, working with medical professionals and data scientists through a mode of reflective engagement.

				Despite the proliferation of STS scholarship on biomedicalization, pharmaceuticalization, and geneticization, studies interrogating the social construction, regulation, and political economy of medical devices remain slim. Yet, past studies have shown how medical devices and technologies are rich sites for STS investigation. Medical devices are increasingly used in routine clinical care, and include a broad range of objects from MRI machines to assays to surgical implants. Medical devices are regulated in a variety of ways depending on national contexts. In the United States, medical devices, unlike pharmaceuticals, often come to market without rigorous safety and efficacy testing or clinical trials. This regulatory environment purports to encourage innovation, but it also creates uncertainty surrounding potential harm to the public. What regulatory regimes exist in different nations to approve and govern medical devices and innovation? What standards of proof are needed to gain regulatory approval in particular contexts? How do the ways in which medical devices are regulated impact patient care and safety? How does medical device innovation shape scientific knowledge about human bodies, health, and illness? What shapes the political economies of medical device development, adoption, and use? We seek empirical contributions that explore questions about the political economy and regulation of medical technologies and devices, their construction, and the developers who create them. We particularly are interested in papers that examine the implications of emergent medical technologies and devices for inequality and health justice.

				At the 2020 4S/EASTS conference, the panel “Locating South Asia in Social Studies of Science and Technology” aimed to bring together research on South Asia that are otherwise scattered across different topical 4S panels. By bringing together the research communities of South Asia, it aimed to render visible and consolidate conceptual vocabularies, epistemological, ontological and ethical concerns, and methods involved in researching South Asia. This year’s panel is a “bridgework” that draws together the ongoing effort to revisit different pasts of STS in South Asia to intervene in its present and explore possible future avenues for research, collaboration, interdisciplinary and transnational speculations. Papers that explore the following questions are welcome to apply:
1)	How does the STS work in South Asia relate with STS areas and theories including Sociology of Scientific Knowledge, Actor-Network Theory, New Materialisms, Indigenous and Postcolonial Studies?
2)	How do such theories when applied to the context of South Asia emerge with unique sensibilities in your research?
3)	How can relating STS to anthropological and sociological work on scientific knowledge and technoscientific development in South Asia question “the imperialism of [Global North] categories” in research as an effort towards decolonializing STS?
4)	What are the other sciences that are possible in “a world of sciences” and technologies when technoscience is viewed “from below?”  (Harding; Wiley) 
Hence, this panel also aims to investigate the diversity loss in sciences and livelihood losses due to the (de-)legitimizing tactics of modern science. Papers that focus on any STS areas in the context of South Asia including but not limited to technoscientific development of nation states, computational politics, legal, social and environmental justice, public understanding of science, Anthropocene, and postcolonialism may apply.

				From its origins, cybernetics has based its desire on the concept of transverse nature, today transdisciplinary. Within its history, the breaking point is undoubtedly Stafford Beer and the VMS applied in Salvador Allende’s government. Chile’s historical conditions and context undoubtedly allowed a series of conceptual emergencies that were not necessarily developed after the 1973 coup d’état. Beer’s design, as he claims, could serve both a socialist vision and a fascist command. This tells us that the tool depends on the hand of the administrator. On the other hand, good but insufficient attempts have been made in the field of biologies, such as the theory of autopoiesis and epistemological positions concerning the observer, which have not been able to add value to the VMS. The errors in the design of the VMS can be summarized as follows:
 Confusion of interactions with relationships
 Confusing Co-Autonomy with Self-Organization
 Confusion of centrism and centralities necessarily as central,
 Establish isomorphisms in a mathematical system aiming at conceptual homologation. As is the case with Information and Entropy.
This work shows that the VMS must obligatorily migrate to a Relational Viable system, whose bases are the relations of cooperation and reciprocity based on heterarchical structures for limited or scarce material energy resources (Third Order Cybernetic). This is the basis of the socialist design which forces the economy to reduce the production of Non-Required Variety.",147,Cybernetics, Latinamerica, Socialism, Third-order, Relational,NA,NA,NA,Governance and Public Policy,"Information, Computing and Media Technology",Social Justice/Social Movement

				This session takes its inspiration from transformations in manufacturing and digitization that have been observed around the world in the aftermath of COVID-19. The fast spread of the pandemic led to shortages in Personal Protective Equipment and other medical devices essential for healthcare. As an expression of practices and methods in uncertain times these resulted in a surge of maker and hacker movements dedicated to producing this equipment through 3D-printing and other means. Simultaneously there has been an increase in digitization of healthcare through telemedicine and virtual consults, mostly governmentally mandated. So, on the one hand, we are dealing with a highly altruistic-seeming provision of aid by several communities of practice, while on the other hand, governments have an interest in building in certain control mechanisms to ensure certainty. While there has been a long standing interest in STS in how technologies mediate action, we are interested in exploring how these objects/technologies  become entangled in new sociotechnical imaginaries as they intertwine forms of responsibility, solidarity and care. What kind(s) of relations are enabled through these new practices? How do they unsettle existing structures of expertise?
This session will bring together scholars who are interested in analyzing the ambivalences and challenges of these new practices in divergent settings. We are interested in both empirical and theoretical analyses that address the following questions:
How is care reflected in these emerging sociotechnical assemblages?
How do maker communities conceptualize technical creation, expertise and collective action?
What do these emerging practices mean for vulnerable populations? ",148,enabling technologies, maker movement, expertise, healthcare, 3D printing,NA,NA,NA,Medicine and Healthcare,Science Communication/Public Engagement,Social Justice/Social Movement

				This panel seeks to convene current critical engagements on the (extra-)terrestrial, the cosmos and their material entanglements with Earth and its human and non-human inhabitants. We situate this panel within the thematic emphasis of 4S 2021 Good Relations and will explore active reimaginings of interpersonal and inter-institutional relations surrounding space science infrastructures and environments. Can we have Good Relations within and between groups interested in space and the cosmos who have different priorities, epistemologies, and approaches? Are there practices and methods that could bridge differences between (un)equal stakeholders? What would decolonial approaches to space science look like? How might space science and exploration fit within diverse reparations frameworks?
The landscapes of space science on Earth are global and varied. They span labour practices, land uses, and channelling of other resources (for example extracted minerals, clear skies, capital). In this session, we draw attention to those displaced, impacted by, excluded from, or allowed conditional access to the terrestrial environments and artifacts (objects, waste, data) of Outer Space, and to resistive and restorative practices that can or have been undertaken. We especially encourage contributions that take decolonial, Indigenous, queer, and/or feminist approaches to understanding, reimagining, and transforming terrestrial relationships with Outer Space. We are interested in a range of methods, practices, and praxes to understand human and non-human relationships with terrestrial environments of Outer Space.

				Social struggles for the recognition of Rights of Nature (RoN) cast new light on core STS concerns regarding knowledge, expertise, plurality and multiple modernities. A legal reformulation of what counts as Nature – coupled with the demand that ecosystems have a right to exist and regenerate – the RoN concept presents radical new challenges, opportunities, and questions for how science, society, and the natural world interact. RoN have the potential to transform scientists’ work and relationship to nature and thus to fundamentally reshape scientific knowledge production.
As more domains around the world consider and enshrine different forms of RoN – for example, in Ecuador, India, Chile, Florida (USA), Australia, Philippines, New Zealand – this panel brings together work that draws on STS insights to better understand how these legal, ontological, and epistemological changes affect our understanding of (and practices and methods for sustaining) good relations (e.g., Yaka 2019). 
Drawing on critiques of development (e.g., Acosta 2010), movements for RoN advocate rights that protect the wellbeing of a broader range of beings, relations, and kin – both in the present and in the future. We welcome contributions that reflect on these issues and questions such as: how are the contours of rationalist science redefined when its practices recognize nature as a rights-bearing subject? Does advancing the participation of indigenous peoples in the natural sciences reshape and correct historic, systemic injustices or, conversely, exacerbate ongoing historical trends of erasure and co-optation (Temper 2019)?

				In human diversity research, race is a moving target. It is rarely clearly defined, and takes on different meanings and labels in different contexts, and often reveals itself as racialized connotations of other terms. From an international perspective, it is apparent that while race is used in political and scientific contexts in the USA or Brazil, for example, in continental Europe, by contrast, today it is commonly considered a taboo. This difference is partly rooted in divergent conceptual meanings in different languages, and various political as well as scientific strategies for dealing with the historical burden of the concept. However, even in countries that are largely imagined as post-racial, race remains as an “absent presence” (M’charek/Schramm/Skinner 2014) within other terms in use such as “ethnicity”, “population”, “migrant background”, “biogeographical ancestry”, “metapopulation” etc.
In this panel we welcome contributions inquiring into the national, disciplinary and/or temporal specifics of human difference categorizations – with a focus on, but not limited to, the life sciences. We are particularly interested in the shaping of processes of categorization and in the continuity and discontinuity of concepts of group classification across/in different contexts and specific situations.
 Possible topics include:
* entanglements between race and “ethnicity”, “caste”, “populations” etc.
* context-specific and language-related differences and similarities between racialized concepts, wordings, meanings, and their historical dis/continuities
* travelling concepts, translations, euphemisms, modernizations, and equivocations
* processes of racialization in various scientific disciplines
* race after race, post-racial racializations, racializations in antiracism
* effects of notions like “colourblindness”, “race-consciousness”, “race realism”, “social constructivism”
* different bureaucratic-administrative regulations of race, e.g. in the law, in affirmative action, surveys, censuses etc.
* attempts to grasp diversity/variation in a non-racialized manner ",151,race, ethnicity, life sciences, human categorization, genetics,NA,NA,NA,"Genetics, Genomics, Biotechnology",Medicine and Healthcare,Race and Racism

				Studies of information representation practices have shown that knowledge productions are conditioned by the affordances of those representing practices/systems like information architectures, classification schemas, and database management systems (Bowker&Star 2000; Bowker 2005; Poirier 2017) and that those systems’ affordances are materialized, carrying their own weight despite information’s supposed immateriality/virtuality (Edwards, 2010; Chun 2011; Dourish 2017; Jones 2017; Ribes 2017). Nevertheless, data processing practices having been parallelized and scaled out for last decades, from Google’s MapReduce, Spanner, BigTable (enabling to replace oligopolistic vendors’ proprietary software/hardware solutions with open-sourced/commodified software/hardware combinations), through Apache Hadoop (modeling Google’s distributed software), to Transformer (a more parallelizable deep-learning model, on which OpenAI’s GPT-3 was built) to name a few, have been less scrutinized, though these distributed practices contributed much to solving scalability issues (c.f. Ribes 2014) in ever-increasing resource-heavy computing systems, being epistemically infrastructured (Malazita 2019).
    This panel seeks to collectively problematize those distributed systems for storing, indexing, retrieving, and pattern-recognizing data, and explore the themes/methods including,-but-not-limited-to,
– How have distributed/parallel computing architectures (either software-or-hardware, or both) and algorithmic/programming models appeared in relation to others (Stevens 2013; Dourish 2016)? How are materialities and scalabilities related there?
– Which hegemonic cultural/societal norms have those parallel systems and then-contemporary societies had in common (McPherson 2012)?
– Are there any homogenizing, mono-cultural/geographical, or proprietary conditions these distributed computing machineries demand? By which methods would those conditions be noticed? What consequences follow? if those conditions should be cancelled/loosened, which alternatives (e.g. computing “of” the South) be needed (Amrute&Murillo 2020; Takhteyev 2012; Ochigame 2020)?

Scaling the Ethical Plateaus of Energy Justice,"Alison Kenner, Drexel University","James Adams, University of California, Irvine",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Posted: January 27, 2021
","
				
				
				Energy systems are in a state of flux. Climate change, the COVID-19 pandemic, the collapse of oil and destabilized energy economies have forced the world’s energopolitical regimes (Boyer 2019) to grapple with new and evolving demands on and for energy infrastructures. These geopolitical shifts signal both emerging windows of opportunity and causes for concern, as the ethical plateaus that have come to define contemporary energy ecologies rupture at their fault lines. 
The growing set of diverse conceptual complements with which energy is often paired (e.g., energy rights, energy vulnerability, energy democracy, energy transitions, etc.) betray different assumptions about the scales and systems of relevance to energy politics and to processes of sociotechnical change. Energy justice, by contrast, calls for a more holistic view of the ethics informed by unique energy ecologies—i.e. the historically and culturally specific modes of relating to one’s self, to other humans, to non-human life, and to the environment through one’s relationship to energy and energy infrastructures. This means that more nuanced attention is needed to account for and enact just energy relations in situ.  
We welcome papers that develop empirical or theoretical takes on energy justice by attending to the subtleties of the ethical conundrums posed by complex energy ecologies. We are particularly interested in papers that advance feminist and anti-racist analysis, critique white supremacy and settler colonialism, and/or leverage transnational frameworks to think through the ethical plateaus of energy justice.

				The landscape of Traditional, Complementary and Alternative Medicine (TCAM) is constantly evolving, not only as health practices but also as a research field and as an object of knowledge. So far, much of social science research about TCAM has focused in individual use and on various aspects of professionalization and integration in conventional health care. However, in recent years there has been a growing interest in exploring TCAM from STS perspectives. For example, how can we understand aspects of knowledge production, professionalization, standardization, legitimacy, ethics, globalization, and integration of TCAM – if focusing on material practices, hybridity, actor networks, social worlds or boundary work?
In this panel we welcome papers on various aspects of TCAM. In particular we invite papers that target the role of STS theories and methods in studying TCAM. Papers could include e.g. the following themes:
•	Knowledge production and knowledge systems in TCAM
•	TCAM at university: teaching, research and institutions
•	Contestation of biomedicine related to TCAM, vaccine hesitancy and other lifestyles
•	Resistance of medicalization and technologization in TCAM modalities
•	Public understanding of science within TCAM modalities
•	TCAM healers and practitioners in biomedical settings
•	Technologies within TCAM
•	The relation and integration of TCAM with evidence-based medicine
•	The interplay between lay knowledge and expert knowledge in TCAM
•	Hidden and/or suppressed knowledges (of e.g. women or traditional healers) within TCAM
•	Challenges of expertise and expert knowledge related to TCAM ",154,complementary medicine, traditional knowledge, CAM, knowledge production, biomedicine,NA,NA,NA,Medicine and Healthcare,Postcolonial STS,NA

				With Human kind facing challenges such as a global emergency, science and technology have become crucial tools for tackling them. Addressing such grand problems requires the coordinated efforts of researchers, diplomats, and policy makers and has given rise to the emerging field of Science Diplomacy (SD). SD is defined as “all practices in which actions of researchers and diplomats interact” bridging science with international relations. As globalization is causing traditional geographic and geopolitical boundaries to reconfigure, international interactions occur faster and more comprehensively than ever. In addition, the transnational nature of complex problems requires intense international dialogues involving actors from different countries and regions. In this context, the international role of science is more evident than ever particularly in respect to the 2030 sustainable development agenda. In times of critical global challenges, such as climate change and pandemics (as Covid-19), science diplomacy could play a crucial role. This is because the creation of synergies goes beyond the institutions that sign treaties and agreements, involving other actors such as the scientific community, the private and public sectors, and multilateral organizations. 
Countries located in Europe and North America have made progress discussing the content of SD, however, the voices of scholars from other regions are needed for developing an inclusive and holistic approach.  Latin America, a region in which societies face different moments in their development stage, is particularly vulnerable when trying to participate in the global economic growth paradigm that is based on scientific and technological advances. Challenges experienced by Latin American societies include heterogeneity, diversity, multi-ethnicity, and inequality. Although, these features might be present in other societies from Europe, North America and Africa as well, regional specificities are important to be taken into account for the nearly 600 million people that inhabit Latin America sharing common cultural, linguistic, historical and religious backgrounds.
This panel aims to showcase discussions on Science Diplomacy and Sustainable Development from Latin American countries in order to highlight their particular challenges as heterogeneous, diverse, multi-ethnic, and unequal societies. It addresses the need for science to be internationally discussed as actors from different countries and regions engage in collaborative efforts towards shared objectives in seeking sustainable development from the perspective of Latin America. 
We invite works in relation to science diplomacy and sustainable development in the following subtopics:
– Interdependence, complexity, and political challenges
– Governance of Science and Technology
– Economics of Development
– Budgets and the sustainable development agenda 2030
– Science and technology policy
– International Relations and new global scientific paradigms
– Communication of Science in Latin America ",155,Science Diplomacy, Sustainable Development, STI, Governance, Diplomacy and Soft Power, Latin America,NA,NA,Environmental/Multispecies Studies,Governance and Public Policy,Transnational STS

				As in other areas of public policy, isomorphism is a recurrent trait in Science, Technology and Innovation Policy (STIP). Countries submitted to similar economic global forces, pressures exercised by multilateral organizations, and increasingly transnationalized politicians, bureaucracies and epistemic communities contribute to the design of STIP in non-hegemonic countries that are remarkably similar in rationales, goals and instruments to the ones created by central capitalist economies. Consider, for instance, the blossoming of biotechnology, nanotechnology and information and communication technologies programs around the world in the 2000s, or the relentless impulse to innovation (and its adjectives) as the main goal of STIP over the last two decades or so. Quite often, such policies have limited effectiveness, due to local funding scarcity, lesser previous development of scientific capacities, implementation pitfalls, discontinuity or, even, because foreign-inspired policy designs do not address adequately local problems, actors and contexts. However, policy adaptation, translation and even contestation occur, processes that change originally similar policy designs in diverse directions. In the spirit of the 4S Conference theme, in this panel we want to explore methods and practices of designing, adapting, translating and challenging centrally produced STIP models in non-hegemonic countries and assess such practices in terms of their adequacy to address local problems. We invite scholars and graduate students to discuss STIP through case or comparative studies, in national and transnational settings, and using diverse methodologies.

				While sport studies scholars have established sport as a key site of cultural meanings and social relations, fewer scholars have engaged these issues within technology and science studies frameworks. This intersection of critical sport, science, and technology studies is key to understanding their current and future collisions and impacts, particularly in this moment of increasing technoscientific proliferation and practice.
This panel invites papers broadly concerned with social and cultural inquiry into the intersection of science, technology, and sport. Potential topics include, but are not limited to: sport analytics, data science, algorithmic culture, and the quantified self; issues related to medicine, risk, and sport; performance enhancement and bioethics; sporting labs and technoscientific practices; elite, professional, and commercial sporting practices in relation to digital objectivity, player performance, injury prevention, player valuation, etc.; public understandings, consumption, and perceptions of sport science and sport technology; professional gaming and eSports; (new) media and other representations and circulations of science, technology and sport; science, technology and sport in relation to (dis)ability, gender, race, class, and sexuality; infrastructure, sustainability, and sport; and (digital) sporting futures.
In addition, given the focus of the conference theme and the ongoing and heightened importance to reflect upon and interrogate current and future uncertainties, papers that center ethics or social justice research, draw upon Indigenous, anti-racist, feminist, queer, postcolonial and/or transnational scholarship, address oppressions and inequality, or situate relations between sport, science, and technology within the COVID-19 pandemic are especially welcome.

				One effect of the coronavirus pandemic was to shift scientific conferences online. From seminars and workshops to international conferences, previously in-person experiences became online events. This ‘natural experiment’ prompts us to re-examine the benefits and costs of traditional academic meetings and evaluate them against their virtual alternatives. STS research has long seen scientific conferences as a crucial site for the production of knowledge, with the informal interactions between participants particularly important for refreshing existing networks and enabling new and creative networks to form. Of course, all this comes well-recognised costs. On the on hand, there is the obvious environmental cost. On the other, there is the way the conference industry reinforces and reproduces inequalities of gender, race and geography with those most able to attend – and benefit from attending – coming from already advantaged backgrounds. One claim made, therefore, for the online conferences that emerged during covid lockdowns is that they provide a viable alternative to the environmentally damaging and socially discriminatory practices of in-person conferences. In its strongest form, the claim is that in-person meetings are simply not needed anymore. In this panel, we welcome papers that critically examine the claims made for and against both online and in-person conferences and, in so doing, address questions such as what functions can only be performed by in-person meetings and hence justify the environmental cost, what kinds of meetings can be moved online with no significant cost, and how can equitable access to all scientific meetings – virtual or in-person be promoted.

Semiosis in the Lab: The Language of Practising Scientists,"Joseph Wilson, University of Toronto",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Posted: January 27, 2021
","
				
				
				One of the barriers to communicating effective scientific practice and policy to the general public is the difference in the registers spoken by scientists and members of the general public. When this gap between the scientific ‘empiricist’ register and the everyday ‘contingent’ register remains large, it can lead to cynicism, uncertainty, and at worst, distrust and fear amongst nonspecialists (Gilbert & Mulkay 1984). The fields of linguistic anthropology, sociolinguistics, pragmatics, and sociology, amongst others have attended to different aspects of ‘semiosis in the lab’ through such varied methodologies as participant-observation (Traweek 1988; Forsythe 2001), semi-structured interviews (Gilbert & Mulkay 1984; Martin 1987), body language (Ochs et al. 1996; Hao & Hood 2017), conversation analysis and ethnomethodology (Goodwin 2018; Lynch 1993), historical discourse analysis (Hesse 1980, 1966; Brown 2003; Collins & Pinch 2012), poetics (Bielo 2019), and critical metaphor analysis (Black 2018; Martin 1987). In order to develop and maintain ‘good relations’ between practising scientists and the public, social scientists have a role to play in ‘translating’ the process of semiosis in the laboratory (or wherever scientists practice their trade), into registers that are accessible to a wider audience (Satsuka 2015). This panel will assemble scholars performing research at the intersection between language, semiotics and science studies, specifically in the analysis of semiosis in real-time research situations instead of in highly mediated forms such as formal papers or science textbooks.

				Drones and mounted cameras monitoring wildfire ignitions. Satellites detecting areas of deforestation and reforestation or the transport of agents through ocean currents. Weather stations tracking humidity and rainfall surrounding monocrops. Video cameras poised to capture evidence of rare or threatened species, while bodies and wearable medical devices register the presence and passage of industrial pollutants. Sensors and modes of sensing are part of infrastructures that monitor and mobilize environments, constituting atmospheres of data, knowledge production, and world-making (Gabrys 2019). These ‘sense ecologies’ are differentially charged with promise when imagined and enacted (Spackman and Burlingame 2018), sometimes with expectations that they might deliver a world without surprises (Masco 2014). In practice, the promise of recent and new environmental sensing technologies are highly ambivalent. Their proliferation has been crucial to projects that hold powerful state and non-state actors to account, while (often concurrently) being enlisted as vectors for state securitization, targeted discrimination, corporatization and neoliberal intrusion (Mansfield 2008). Whatever their use, new sensing technologies are powerful, often compromised (Liboiron 2017), and are increasingly widespread means for imagining, constituting and intervening in environments. This open panel seeks contributions that examine new techno-imaginaries of environmental surveillance, including (but not limited to) analyses of sense ecologies and their ‘good’ or ‘bad’ relations, sites and practices of sensing, the promises of sensing technologies, ecologies of attuned sensing, distributed sensing networks, and the privatisation of sense ecologies.

				From Viagra to Truvada to Gardasil, pharmaceuticals have profoundly impacted sex and sexuality. Counting, measuring, and classifying sexual behaviors have been key technoscientific practices to advance pharmacological sex therapies. These drugs, implemented in varied and in contradictory ways, have further biomedicalized sexuality and reinforced hegemonic narratives related to binary normative sex and gender. Viagra, a lifestyle drug marketed for aging Western cisgender men in the Global north reinforces normative and gendered understandings of eroticism, pleasure, and sex through biomedical measurement of erection frequency and time. Other pharmacological sex therapies shift meanings and understandings of sexuality by centering risk and prevention. For example, Truvada, a biomedical HIV prevention technology, leverages sexual behavior data on those classified ‘at-risk’ of HIV to further pathologize homoerotic practices (i.e., bareback sex, Truvada whores). Lessons in the administration of pharmacological sex therapies, such as the mass vaccination of adolescent girls against Human Papilloma Virus though Gardasil is approved for usage across adolescents regardless of biological sex, has reified dominant cultural narratives in relation to female sexuality and risk. This open panel seeks to bring together interdisciplinary scholars to consider, incorporate, and attend to the meanings, uses, and social consequences of pharmaceuticals on sex and sexualities. We are interested in rethinking sexuality amid pharmacological sex therapies, across different substantive sites of research, not only in the implementation of these drugs but also in their development, and in contexts where social and economic uncertainties are present. Contributions from Non-Western countries and the Global South are particularly welcome.

","
				
				
				This session would like to engage with knowledge production and the policy framework of the modern technological landscape from the non-western perspective.  Over the last few decades, the techno-scientific ecosystem has increasingly pointed towards the parity between ‘West-East,’ ‘Developed-Developing’, and ‘Centre-Periphery’. The session would like to ask provocative questions about the shift in developing research infrastructure, critical decision-making, and power dynamics in a trans-national ‘East-West’ engagement.
For example, the notion of ‘smartness’, a western policy imagination, dominates the technological interventions in the critical infrastructures in South Asia. The deployment of technical artefacts to make the city and its infrastructure networks ‘smart’ has become an integral part of the policy imagination and governance initiatives. These policy imaginations and techno-scientific metaphors possess invisibility towards the non-western context.  The uncritical, non-collaborative adoptionist/diffusionist notion of such imaginations and metaphors could create space for fatal bio-political interventions, such as ethnic marking, racial and class segregation, etc.
These initiatives have demanded the ‘shift’ and visibility for the non-western sites and their engagement in creating scientific artefacts, metaphors and policy interventions. The panel is interested in engaging with the narratives beyond the western world that can provide reflections about the shifting location within the contemporary process of knowledge production and policy initiatives. The session is open for the papers that can provide an assessment from the historical, sociological and STS perspective about the shifting location of the non-western world in knowledge production and devising governance tools.

				Our current realities are a mess to embrace: the current global pandemic and its disruptions in labor, education, and other socio-technical systems; the increasing political and ontological polarizations and the urgent action against a human-catalyzed climate emergence are challenged our notion of safety, certainty, and even the survival of life on earth (as the ongoing massive extinction, and other fateful events). Our cartesian imaginations in fiction, planning, modeling, anticipation, and foresight are being defied for the unknown, opening a public demand for new ecological, material, and inter-mutual relations around the globe.
A source of these imaginations are images of the future. In 1961, Frederick Polak defined it as “images of the totally other, and they are revolutionary and radical in nature, or they are nothing at all”. Future studies have contributed to popularize these images,  (Inayatullah, 2008; Zheltikova & Khokhlova, 2019), which are connected to the movements of decolonial anthropologies and designs (Tlostanova, 2017; Escobar, 2018; Schultz, 2018), as well offer powerful insight for the study of emergent socio-technical imaginaries (Jasanoff, 2015; Konrad & Böhle, 2019).
This panel wants to set a conversation around the role of images of the future in STS, in particular projects and practices looking at local, topical, or systemic images. We hope to have contributions to understanding how to situate, expand, nuance, and (de)centered “images of the futures”, to produce alternative realities (like Afro-futurism or Solar-Punk), and to restore more-than-human balances from the unequal, unbalanced, and unfair relations across scales.

				The rise of sustainability sciences followed the signing of the three Rio conventions (CBD, UNCCD and GCC). Consequently, the last two decades of the 20th century saw the rise from multidisciplinary to inter and transdisciplinary  research dealing with complex systems. Most conservationists ended up accepting that notions of pristine environments have not helped but hindered conservation efforts. Sustainability studies corroborated that the conventional distinction of ecosystems and social systems had made it more difficult to understand socio-ecological interactions. At the same time STS revealed the failure of attempting to increase agro-food resilience capacities through technological means alone.
However, reforms have been uneven not only across the developed and developing world but also across sectors. Worryingly in no other sector have the problems been more acute and the resistance to change more decisive that in agriculture. Agriculture continues to be the main driver of deforestation and habitat loss (WWF 2020). It contributes a significant share of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions -17% through agricultural activities and 7-14% through changes in land use (Howden et.al. 2007; OECD 2020). And although the STS critique of the political use of “desertification” discourse, there is agreement that agriculture continues to be a main driver of soil depletion and erosion.  Therefore, it is urgent to identify the barriers and incentives, facilitating or hindering to transitioning towards sustainable agri-food systems. Presentations of this session would critically examine case studies with view to strengthen collaborative research in this area.

				Demographic ageing and the rapid advancement of technology – especially digital technologies – are important societal trends. It is becoming increasingly clear that these trends are also interrelated. Digital devices, information technologies and mediated systems of communication increasingly shape the social worlds of people in later life. Digital technologies are also increasingly designed specifically with older people in mind. This raises important critical questions about the interaction of techno-scientific practice with meanings of growing and being old. Such questions, for instance, pertain to ageism in design, tensions between visions of late-life independence versus the surveillance of older people, bricolage in the configuration of care technologies, creative uses of social media and other digital apps by older people, or, more generally, interdisciplinary theorizing about the many intertwinements of ageing and technology. 
In recent years, such questions have received growing attention by scholars that work at the intersection of STS and Age Studies to understand the co-constitution of ageing and technology. This dialogue is driven by a strong sense for combining theoretical sensitivities with an activist agenda to improve the quality of life and everyday lives of people as they grow older as these become increasingly intertwineded with technoscientific objects. 
For this session, we invite scholarship at the intersection of STS, Age Studies and Gerontechnology that critically explores such intertwinements of ageing and technology in various empirical domains. In particular, we welcome contributions that explore how STS sensitivities can help do old age policies or gerontechnology design differently.

				Leaving behind its traditional invisibility, in recent years soils have become a topic of growing interest among social scientists, especially STS scholars. One of the most central contributions of this growing field has been the recognition that how we engage with soils matters. The myriad ways in which we interact with soils–from scientific surveys to daily sensorial engagement–are never purely technical or practical, but have important consequences for the way soils are seen and acted upon. Especially through the use of technoscientific devices, soil sensing materializes a particular kind of politics, giving birth to different kinds of power and environmental (in)justices. 
This session aims to convene STS scholars whose work addresses questions about sensing and producing knowledge about soil contents (minerals, organic matter, microorganisms, etc.) and disturbances (pollutants, fertilizers, etc.). In line with the conference theme, we will be especially open to presentations that challenge usual ways to sense soils and/or speculate on novel ways to engage with them.
Potential themes include:
• Conceptual and historical explorations of notions and practices of sensing soil, as well as capabilities and shortcomings of sensory methods.
• Critical engagements with current technical methods and practices for soil sensing, especially focusing on ways to transform them.
• Case studies focused on practices of soil sensing “on the ground” by experts and non-experts, particularly considering issues of environmental (in)justice.
• Speculative designs of alternative concepts and methods that could help us to transform the usual ways in which we engage with soils. ",166,soil, sensing, methods, practices, speculation,NA,NA,NA,Environmental/Multispecies Studies,Food and Agriculture,NA

				Since its birth, the Internet has been viewed as a unifying force, building on a tradition of thinking about communication infrastructures that stretches at least as far back as McLuhan’s “global village” (1964). Yet the history of the Internet illustrates a series of struggles to control a multi-layered network, rather than a technologically-mediated unity. Analyses of these struggles have ranged from those focused on the role of states in controlling the open Internet (Kalathil and Boas 2003; Goldsmith and Wu 2006), to those drawing attention to the dangers of corporate “walled gardens” (Zittrain 2008; van Dijck, Poell, and de Waal 2018), to efforts at identifying geo-political spheres of influence on the Internet (O’Hara and Hall 2018). All of these analyses share a concern that rather than a unified global Internet, we might instead be dealing with a series of fragmented networks (Drake, Cerf, and Kleinwächter 2016; Mueller 2017), or “splinternets” (Malcomson 2016; Hoffmann, Lazanski, and Taylor 2020; Epifanova 2020).
In this panel, we seek papers that build on existing scholarship on fragmented internets to understand from a historical, social and technical perspective the centrifugal and centripetal forces that may change how the Internet works. We are particularly interested in work that unpicks images of split internets which conflate technical, political and commercial considerations, and in work that offers new theoretical, methodological, or empirical insights into current and historical relational processes of fragmentation and unification.

"Struggles for Power, Legitimacy, and Control between Disciplines within Interdisciplinary Research Organizations","Richelle Boone, Leiden University","Simcha Jong, Leiden University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Posted: January 27, 2021
","
				
				
				As the scientific endeavour is increasingly oriented towards addressing ‘global challenges’, interdisciplinary research organisations are becoming ever more important. Within such organisations different disciplinary groups collaborate while at the same time vying for power, legitimacy, and control. Our panel examines how these dynamics affect the work within interdisciplinary research organisations. Unevenly distributed power among participating disciplines and, related to that, divergent disciplinary (epistemic) statuses can for instance be a risk for successful interdisciplinary collaboration (Reich & Reich, 2006). Organization members might for example experience hindering feelings of subordination, or of superiority. And if an organization is part of a wider interdisciplinary field, ‘disciplinary inequalities’ within this field ─ such as unequal funding, publishing or job opportunities for members of different disciplines ─ could be perpetuated or have an impact on the social dynamics at the organizational level.
Questions we seek to address during the panel are: What kind of challenges do disciplinary power struggles pose for the success of interdisciplinary research organizations? Might there be any epistemic effects? And how exactly do the dynamics between members of different disciplines at the scientific field level relate to those at the organizational level? Organizational structures are said to reflect the power relations among constituting groups (e.g. Collins, 1981), is this effect present in interdisciplinary research organizations? Even in cases where policy makers are in charge of determining the organizational set-up? How do, or might, research organizations mitigate ─ for social or epistemic reasons ─ tensions between participating disciplines? In which ways can STS insights, for instance about the hierarchical structure of scientific fields (Albert & Kleinman, 2011), epistemic cultures (Knorr-Cetina, 1999) or (other) laboratory studies observations on power struggles, inform strategies to deal with disciplinary power imbalances in interdisciplinary research organizations?

				Michelle Murphy in her keynote address at the 2016 4S/EASTS meeting, “What a Body can’t do?” called for STS to attend to alterlife—”a politics of entanglement, kinship, and responsibility” that explicates the material enmeshment of the human body with chemical exposures and environmental violence (7). She claims that bodies are already “more-than-bodies” and “they stretch outward to water, air, ancestors and other beings, that stretches backward to messy histories and forward to something else” (11). Today, we find ourselves in tense entanglements of exclusionist relationalities that reify the boundaries which frame the modern subject and their embodiment. Power structures including religion, racism, law, science, technology contribute to the production of otherness within a technoscientific apparatus like nuclear energy, AI, Big Data etc. (Ali). While STS has extensively focused on inclusion and exclusion of beings in technoscientific enactments, the philosophical, sociological, historical and anthropological treatment of the meanings of “alterity” or otherness that emerge under technoscientific duress remain unaddressed. Calling for an STS of alterity, this panel asks,
1)	how and what constitutions of otherness, say human/non-human, is produced in technoscientific enactments?
2)	how the boundaries and relations between self and other are made, unmade and reified through technoscientific enactments?
3)	are these (alter-ed) relations racial, colonial, imperial, postcolonial, gendered?
This panel aims to bring together a large array of research on technoscientific practices and how they produce “otherness.” Papers that explicate the production of otherness in the context of environmental justice and contamination, especially radiation contamination, are particularly welcome. Papers may also interpret STS theories including Actor Network Theory (as called for the by Law), New Materialisms, (Crip) Feminist and anti-racist Technoscience using the frames of “othering” and “alterity.”

STS as Whiteness? Towards Decentering Whiteness in STS,"Gabriel Medina-Kim, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Posted: January 27, 2021

				In 2018, Michael Mascarenhas described STS as a white space through how its programs, institutions, leadership, and inquiries perpetuate white supremacy. This often emerges as colorblindness, an ideology of unmarked whiteness where anti-racialism is assumed to accomplish anti-racism. Although existing STSers work to decenter United States and European geographies and genealogies as the sole sites for STS, many sites of whiteness in STS remain black boxed. Given the position of STS to shape and intervene in technoscientific knowledge production and policy, it is urgent for STSers to deconstruct the whiteness that is reproduced in our work. 
In thinking with the conference theme of Good Relations and the urgency of making and doing STS in ways that decenter white supremacy, this panel will explore what it means for STS and STSers to decenter white supremacy. This includes discussions of the reproduction of whiteness in STS and the alternative relationalities required to decenter whiteness in our scholarship and practice.
Contributions should address questions, including, but not limited to: 
How does STS (including tacit notions of who/what is STS) reproduce whiteness? How might pressures to institutionalize STS or form disciplinary identities foreground whiteness?
How could discussions about the whiteness of STS mask existing critical race and ethnic studies scholarship in STS? 
What possibilities are there for decentering whiteness in conceptual frameworks, pedagogies, scholarship, programs, and practices of STS?  
How might we strategize such that non-white scholars are not disproportionately burdened to decenter whiteness? ",170,whiteness, critical race STS, colorblind racism, white supremacy, whiteness in STS,NA,NA,NA,"Critical Race Studies, Black Studies, and STS",Method and Practice,Race and Racism

				How can STS scholars spread their work and ideas outside of academia? In the last decade, STS has demonstrated a broad commitment to extending the rails of its scholarship. Yet even well-meaning tech activists like Tristan Harris and Cathy O’Neil have seemed unaware of even the existence of the field, much less the contributions it could make to public debates. And when STS scholarship does appear in popular works, such as in Planet of the Humans, things sometimes go off the rails. But the interdiscipline has immense potential to help with impending crises, such as climate change or “post-truth” politics. At the very least, it is imprudent to allow scientistic narratives proffered by people like Michael Shellenberger or techno-fixes proposed by Mark Zuckerberg to dominate the media.
The purpose of this panel is to share knowledge and collaborate in imagining how STS trained people could be more effective “thoughtful partisans,” how their research and analysis could more reliably influence policy debates. We are interested in panelists who can speak to: How to pitch STS-inspired op-eds to popular outlets? How to reach out to and work with journalists and documentary filmmakers? How to run a successful podcast or YouTube channel? Participants should be open to non-traditional panel formats, ones that allow more interaction and sharing with attendees.

				What does it mean to engage in “good relations” in worlds that unfold after violence and destruction? How does STS respond to wounded worlds? This panel interrogates the vitalities of destruction not from universalist standpoints but from the politics wounded knowledges, ecologies of practice, and geographies demand. We think with those Argentinian Mothers of Plaza de Mayo who reject economic reparations as a way to keep the wounds of state terror open; the expansion of extractivist practices in a “post-conflict” Colombia —which also organizes the assassination of those who seek alternative worldings; and the Original Peoples in Tierra del Fuego who, after being objectivized as extinct, are re-emerging as wounded collectives. We want to think how to politicize the marks that borders and divides make upon subjects, natures, and knowledges. How does one re-politize their excesses? the failed separations (Segato, 2018), the “interstitial tissue of the social” that connects/separates worlds after violence (Dewachi 2015), or the “not-seen” of destructing worlds that are also exceeded by the impossibility of such destruction and separation (de la Cadena, 2017). We seek a feminist contribution that acknowledges how technoscience is not only situated but also traced, marked, and haunted by histories and stories of violence and displacement. How can feminist STS doings avow these histories and stories? Contributions might focus on wounded knowledges, subjects, histories, and narratives, on the worlding of ending worlds, post-conflict scenarios, postcolonial politics, postnatural effects, ecologies of late capitalism, extinction, disappearance, after life, after atrocity, and after destruction.

				Since Daiwie Fu first asked ‘how far can East Asian STS go?’ in the inaugural issue of East Asian Science, Technology and Society in 2007, many scholars have considered the limits and possibilities of STS in the Asian region. This open panel seeks to build on these conversations, drawing on empirical studies of technoscience within, across and beyond Asia.
A persistent theme in explorations of STS and Asia has been the troubling of critiques based on west/non-west binaries, recognizing instead processes of creolization, hybridity and syncretism in both technoscience and in STS scholarship. As the centre of geopolitical gravity shifts to what is increasingly called the Indo-Asia-Pacific, Asia is the site of novel imaginaries and bold experimentation in every aspect of 21st century life – from energy transition to biosecurity to gene editing to surveillance capitalism – that are shaped by intersecting legacies of European and Asian colonialisms, ongoing Indigenous dispossession and persecution of minority groups, ecological collapse and acute vulnerability to climate change.
Contributing to discussions that have begun through the new TransAsiaSTS Network, we seek papers on all aspects of technoscience that contribute to answering questions such as: What can STS offer the study of technoscience in Asia and what does Asia offer STS? What kind of categories are ‘STS in Asia’ or ‘Asian STS’? How do they relate to Indigenous, queer, feminist, postcolonial, decolonial, and posthuman inflections of STS scholarship? How can scholarly infrastructures better support STS research and research training in the region? How can collaborations in the region contribute to building solidarities and strengthening civil societies? How might these in turn inform practical efforts on the ground? What possibilities can emerge from comparisons of STS in/from/and Asia and other regional formations, located in Northern as well as Southern contexts?

				Science and engineering education bear significant responsibility in fostering democratic and just technoscientific practice, especially given the complicity of technoscience in several social injustices. For example, AI-based surveillance has reinforced the marginalization of minorities, while the use of toxic chemicals in the electronics industry has caused several worker miscarriages. However, pressured by a market-driven system that prioritizes technical skills, this responsibility is often relegated to ethics or STS courses that are separated from the core science/engineering curriculum. Further, as Dr. Timnit Gebru’s recent exit from Google illustrates, the environments of professional technoscience are often themselves averse to critically analyzing issues of social justice and ethics in their practice. Consequently, science and engineering students seldom learn how to engage with social justice as it relates to the subject-matter and methods of technoscience. This is problematic as it can promote agnosticism or even antagonism towards considering the role of technoscience in perpetuating social injustices and inequity. 
How can we teach science/engineering for social justice in a system that often devalues social justice? In this panel, we invite submissions that critically engage with this question through theoretical and/or practical work. Examples include but are not limited to (re)designing and discussing:
	•	Classroom strategies, courses, or curricula
	•	Digital educational media such as games, simulations, and information visualizations
	•	Policies and power dynamics of the educational system
	•	Personal narratives as educators, administrators, or students

				The infrastructure and practices for administering colonization, slavery, and capitalist heritable property relations are the basis for proliferating genealogical technologies, from DNA databases to family tree websites. These technologies materially and socially support white settler genealogical practices that identify away from responsibilities for the material conditions and effects of whiteness, and towards race shifting and the appropriation of racialized identities. 
However, increasingly people are also developing projects for claiming kin that do not erase the histories and ongoing practices of land theft, genocide, enslavement, and border militarism. Examples include projects such as Enslaved: Peoples of the Historic Slave Trade, and work by scholars like Darryl Laroux, who traces genealogical claims to Metis identity made by white settlers in the Canadian context. Such projects situate people in their family and social milieus, including as captives and captors, on lands that have histories, enabling forms of reckoning and a reconsideration of “good relations.”
For this open panel, we invite papers that investigate data, stories, material practices, and dreaming that allow people to claim kin other than the typical history of genealogy. What are the forms of relationality through which people might “claim bad kin,” or collect their relations when their relations are the agents of tremendous harm? What practices of claiming kin resist the social organization of forgetting of histories, familial and otherwise, that fall outside the settler state’s conception of being related? How do we build relationality in new kin formations, and what social and technical practices support such work?

				The advancement of reproductive technologies has not only made an impact on how life emerge; technologies also remake death and dying at the beginning of life. In fertility clinics surplus embryos raise questions regarding if, when, and how they can be discarded or used for non-reproductive means. Ultrasonography used for prenatal diagnosis situate expecting parents in situations of whether they should terminate the pregnancy when fetal malformations are detected, and infants some time die even though technologies are used to keep them alive. Moreover, new technologies are developed in regards to handling dead bodies. This includes post-mortem diagnostics or the development of cooling technologies, such as the cooling cot, a technology that may enable new bereavement practices.
  In this panel, we welcome presentations that explore in which ways technologies are part of death and dying at the beginning of life around the globe, by asking: How are technologies of death and dying regulated, practiced and lived with? How do technologies impact when a life is deemed killable and grievable? How do processes and conceptualizations of death and dying alter as technologies are increasingly involved in reproduction? How do parents or the medical staff involved, live with the deaths that emerge with technologies? And what are the theoretical implications of rethinking technologies of life to also focus on technologies of death? Finally, we welcome reflections on the politics of ontology, and conceptualizations of technologies of dying, as death at the beginning of life is explored.

				Policing has always relied on technologies to assist in the spatial management and social control of populations. Recently, digital technologies have become increasingly central to police operations, which parallels a shift to more proactive forms of policing. Predictive policing, online surveillance, biometrics, facial recognition, machine learning, body cameras, gunshot detection, interoperable databases, and drones connect to existing police technologies as many departments attempt to shift to ‘intelligence-led’ or ‘data-driven’ approaches. With the current public crisis facing policing, there has been a growing questioning of the effects of technologies, computation, and data on practices of policing. How can STS approaches contribute to studying policing in its situated contexts, considering the uneven and often fraught implementation of technology? Given how little we know about what technologies of policing, or even policing as a technology itself can do, we invite perspectives and approaches that study the material impacts of policing. In this panel, we seek to include a diverse set of concerns and methods in order to reveal new depths and breadth to our understanding of how technologies of policing and policing as technology function and transform each other. These might include theoretical, methodological, or empirical contributions that, for example, historicize policing technologies (Jefferson, 2020); engage ethnographically with police officers, departments, or technology developers (Brayne, 2017); experiment with policing algorithms (Lum & Isaac, 2016); and more. Further, given the disproportionate use of violence against marginalized members of our communities, we encourage approaches that consider how to center resistive and abolitionist approaches in studying policing.

				This panel will seek to understand what it means to practice good relations between technologies and humans who adhere to the Islamic way of life. Islam is one of the world’s dominant (23% of the world identify as Muslim) and fastest-growing major religion. While there is much scholarship that focuses on Islam’s spiritual and cultural aspects, there is a paucity of research that considers the relationship between Islam and modern computing technologies. We call for research that focuses on understanding the designs, (non)uses, improvisations, and regulations around the “techno-spiritual” practices of Muslim populations globally. 
We construe technology broadly and welcome scholarship that offers a more nuanced understanding of Islam and technology design from various scholarly traditions, including sociology, law, anthropology, communication, STS, environmental science, political science, social work, gender studies, health and philosophy. We define “Islam” as an umbrella term for representing different practices of Islam around the world. We hope to contribute to discussions of how technologies shape and are, in turn, shaped by the religious practices within Muslim communities. These practices have implications for development, privacy, security, human rights, social justice, health, substance abuse rehabilitation, sustainability, and islamophobia, while also addressing the broader question around the othering of the Islamic faith from modern Science and Technology practices.
In bringing this panel together, we hope to draw attention to Muslim communities’ values and needs, in order to initiate a larger conversation about the technology needs of faith-based communities, which have been largely overlooked by the research community.

				People are increasingly tasked with both the aesthetic and scientific management and optimization of their bodies. For women and non-binary people, in particular, “health” and “beauty” are not simply individual achievements, but comprise the terrain in which battles over the “fitness of the race and the nation” have been played out (Strings 2019:194). Technologies from X-ray machines to Fitbits are mobilized in these fights. STS has analyzed how gender and racial ideologies are embedded within such technologies. This panel draws attention to technologies of the body with a particular eye toward aesthetics. How does the body become articulated, legible, and fortified through the use of technology? We are especially interested in everyday, mundane objects that have often not been analyzed as technologies, such as cosmetics, clothing, and accessories. Technologies of embodiment like cosmetics have been dismissed as commodities or frivolities. But subjects use them to resist subordination and to express themselves in ways that can subvert oppression at personal and structural scales.
We invite submissions of papers about technologies of embodiment, enhancement and adornment, especially on the following subjects: 
-The disruption of the binary between natural and artificial
-The enforcement of the gender binary, heteronormativity, and transmisogyny
-The construction or disruption of racial and colonial formations

				Throughout history, the future has been an important reference for mankind. Its role for life in the present, however, has changed significantly in the course of time. While the future was initially found to be unalterable, with the development of modern societies it became to be understood as an open horizon that stands in a causal relationship to the present – the future got shapable according to actions and decisions in the present.
This shift in terms of interpreting the future made it even more attractive than before to produce knowledge about it. Predictive strategies subsequently flourished and technologies thereby played an increasingly important role.
With the advent of modern forms of algorithmic data analysis, with machine learning and artificial intelligence gaining center stage, another shift in referring to the future is likely, presenting an exciting as well as urgent challenge for social sciences in general and STS in particular.
Before this backdrop, this panel aims to discuss the theoretical as well as empirical implications of algorithmic prediction in the datafied society. What effects does the algorithmization of prediction have on the systems, settings and situations concerned? How do algorithmic predictive technologies differ from their – allegedly less sophisticated – technological predecessors? And, last but not least, where are the analytical possibilities and limits of STS approaches regarding the algorithmic turn of prediction?

The Biomedicalization of Social Medicine?,"Anne Lie, University of Oslo","Jeremy A Greene, Johns Hopkins University",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Posted: January 27, 2021
","
				
				
				Biomedicalization scholars have argued that studies of biomedicalization need to be situated in their geopolitical context and within that context’s history of approaches to health and healing (Clarke et al 2010). Biomedicalization can be absent in some sites, or it can be contested by a diverse set of other approaches to healing (such as non-Western practices of medicine). Yet such contestations within the field of medicine itself have often been overlooked in the literature on biomedicalization. One such field is social medicine, a a field concerned with the social determinants of health and the relations of medicine and social justice. 
In this panel, we trace the blurred and contested boundaries between social medicine and biomedicine. Some practices of social medicine have included at the same time social forms of care and biomedicalized approaches. Other social medicine practices have explicitly challenged biomedicalization processes. At different times and places, proponents of social medicine have argued that it has been too much  biomedicine (at the expense of social, political and legal approaches), or that it has been too little of it (HIV treatment in low income countries, access to gender-affirming therapy). Sometimes, biomedicalization processes initially promoted by social medicine in the name of solidarity or health equity, have been transformed into more techno-science-dependent forms of practice, sometimes in stratified forms. 
In this open panel, we aim to explore diverse empirical examples of interdependencies, interconnectedness and contestations between biomedicine and social medicine in different historical and contemporary sites.

The Covid-19 Pandemic as a Test of STS Knowledge and Lessons,"Eve Seguin, UQAM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Posted: January 27, 2021

				The Covid-19 pandemic is unparalleled in modern history on both the political and scientific fronts. The only comparable event, the Spanish flu, did not entail the measures of exception such as lockdowns and curfews that we have been witnessing since March 2020. Nor was it accompanied by a similar foregrounding of scientific debate and scrutiny of every scientific or medical pronouncement. The origin and characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, screening tests, medicines and treatments, fatality rates, masks, vaccines, all have turned into issues hotly debated in the public sphere, both at the national and international levels. 
On the surface the pandemic seems to conform to the controversial dynamics of knowledge production and use emphasized by STS in the last four decades or so. From this observation, the premise of the panel is that the outbreak and management of Covid-19 provides us with a unique opportunity to test our widely held conclusions on various dimensions of the science/politics interface. Given that normative and public policy concerns clearly pervade a number of STS works, one may also interrogate the extent to which various Covid actors behave according to the lessons taught by the field.
The problem of whether Covid-19 vindicates and/or challenges STS knowledge and principles can be addressed by investigating at least three thematic clusters. 1. Risk societies and scientific uncertainty. 2. Controversies and scientific consensus formation. 3. Public engagement in science and conspiracy hunting.

				An imposter is commonly understood as a person who pretends to be someone else in order to deceive others. The imposter and practices of impostering, are perhaps as common as making and sustaining distinctions between insiders and outsiders. Despite their omnipresence, the imposter has largely been exploited analytically as a phenomenon that reveals something about an underlying order. This panel – which is a freestanding upshot of the new volume The Imposter as Social Theory edited by the panel conveners –  seeks to expand the discussion on the imposter by understanding imposters as primary engines of indeterminacy, uncertainty and disorder . Instead of exploiting the imposter as a methodological probe for the revelation of social order, this panel suggests the imposter can more fundamentally re-specify social theory and the entire project of theorising. The figure of the imposter, as well as the dramas, disruptions, reactions and questions they engender, enrich long standing STS conversations about relations between appearance and reality and between identity and social order.
The panel invites contributions that explore what the imposter does to our efforts in theorising social order; how we might attend to impostering as a performance; how imposters enact belonging; how accounts of who is and is not an imposter get settled or not; and how to detail the materialities or socio-material conditions through which imposters are brought into being, and emerge as something to be known and detected, e.g. gates, tests, scans, internet, norms and manners.

				What can be made of built and provisional global health infrastructures? How do we begin to depict and analyse the complex workings and material heterogeneity of sprawling networks of people, evidentiary systems, communication channels, and the mundane and seemingly ‘micro’-interacting components and artefacts that make-up, and are made up by, global health work? This panel thinks with and through the many questions raised by the persistence of global health infrastructures, bringing together case studies that centre their coexistence, adaptability, and fragility to challenge the “modern infrastructure ideal” (Furlong 2014). We suggest that the dispersed relations, affects, and transactions that characterize these sociotechnical systems enact and assign meaning to (racial, sexual, gender) differences that congeal infrastructures. In this, we move beyond viewing difference (e.g., non-heterosexuality or blackness) as merely fraught, socially constructed variable that facilitates interventions into health or behaviour. Instead, we consider how forms of difference are conjured, orchestrated, and sedimented within global health infrastructures. Questions pertinent to our discussions include:
How are colonial, racialized, gendered, and other tropes, stereotypes, and assumptions reshuffled and recycled in submerged, non-explicit ways in present-day global health worlds? 
How do global health infrastructures work—not only through multiple layerings of mutually reinforcing networks—but also, more dissonantly, through less-visible repurposings and co-optations that meet unacknowledged exigencies contradictory to the aims of their original architecture?
How do we understand and analyze productions and valuations of deprivation and difference—the vital substrates on which global health infrastructures materialize, animate, flourish, and come undone?

				Debates on ‘post truth’ have become a visible staple of recent STS, the word having gathered media and journalistic attraction — though mostly in the Angloshpere — to include discussions and commentaries in some of the main journals in the field such as Social Studies of Science and Engaging Science, Technology and Society. However, most papers and books published on the subject of ‘post truth’ (within and outside STS) are presented in the form of essays or reflections that are based on little or no firsthand systematic, empirical research, and with limited geographic diversity. In this panel, we propose to bring together STS scholars interested in debating what it means to live in a post-truth age — if we are indeed living in such a new age at all — based on empirical studies. Thus, while ‘post truth’ is most commonly associated with the idea that contemporary societies have entered a period in which facts matter less to public opinion than emotions and personal beliefs, there remains much to be worked out in terms of what, in this respect, distinguishes the current age from others. In this panel we seek to bring together papers based on research that seeks to either rectify or destabilize a taken for-granted, definitive and universalist definition of ‘the post-truth age’, based on evidence of changes to contemporary societies, in a wider variety of contexts, which would justify adopting such an all-embracing concept.

				The benefits and costs of election technologies (voting machines, biometric voter registration and authentication, electronic transmission of results) are now much debated. Despite the criticisms, high-tech voting systems are booming in many parts of the world: for example, half of the countries in Africa have adopted biometrics for voter registration procedures. This panel aims to investigate the transnational circulation of these technologies and the invention of new markets in Africa, Asia and Latin America. Particular attention should be paid to the neoliberal and postcolonial logics underlying the spread of these technologies. Who plays a major role in the roll-out of election technologies in the Global South? To what extent are countries in Africa and elsewhere used as a testing ground by the private companies providing the technologies? We aim to explore the strategies of old and new actors in this field: election commissions, ICT and biometric experts, private firms. A second key objective of this panel is to make sense of the practical effects of election technologies in the countries concerned. In many countries, the technologies have raised high expectations. How do governments, political opponents as well as activists strategically use them? How does the collection of data transform electoral politics and the architecture of the state? As lawyers and privacy advocates face major challenges, perspectives from the Global South and battles fought there are also crucial for the rest of the world. Ultimately, this panel explores how election technologies have shaped our contemporary practices and politics of democracy.

				Healthcare professionals are making increasing use of decision-making support systems. Those tools thrive on the accumulation of socio-demographic and medical data. Ever more detailed databases allow the actors to refine and accelerate diagnoses. Computer-assisted analysis of a large number of clinical studies offer the possibility of optimizing the use of health resources (drugs, organs, vaccines, tests, hospitalizations) by anticipating reactions to treatments and personalizing care. The creation of large national databases dedicated to Covid-19 demonstrate that, more than ever, big data are thought to be the future of healthcare, especially when uncertainty dominates debates. 
The use of big data and predictive tools in health raises many questions at the articulation of socio-technical, legal and ethical levels. Among them: What are the impacts of predictive devices on patients’ care trajectories? What do they imply in terms of equal access to treatments, informed choice and protection of personal data? To what extent should predictive tools (using algorithms, genomic sequencing etc.) and those who design them be allowed to control/impact medical decisions?
This panel seeks to create a dialogue among researchers interested in the use of big data to manage health, in the construction of data processing tools for AI purposes, as well as in the regulation of data access. Whether the papers are based on quantitative or qualitative research, they will be invited to shed light on the impacts of big data on health practices, individual futures, especially for minority groups, and collective imaginary.

				The global economy is experiencing increased digital transformation with its impacts felt globally and in all economic sector. Digitalization enhances productivity with increased impacts on e-governance, telemedicine, distant learning, market access, remote-working, manufacturing et.c
 Digital technological capabilities, however, remain concentrated in technological advanced economies and the digital economy is creating emerging new forms of inequality and wider technological gaps. The rise in digitization has reshaped markets and the world of business and work raising inequalities within economies and distorting income distribution. The distribution of both capital and labor income has become more unequal with income largely shifting from labor to capital. 
Developing countries (especially those in African) will not easily finance digitalization due to the high cost of infrastructure to develop and support robots, automation and other digital technologies. Moreover, the disruptions caused by COVID-19 pandemic has increased the need for digitalization. New forms of nationalisms are growing, border closures and restrictions of movements of humans and goods are all in a bid to stop the spread of the virus. Digitalization is sure to increase if business transactions are to continue. This has made countries to develop national digital polices. However, policy failures of past industrial policies may still hunt this countries.
This panel will contribute to knowledge on how to structure digitalization that will enhance the attainment of sustainable development reducing inequality and technological divide.

				There is a risk that when the story of this current pandemic is written, the images and ideas from places in Euro-America will overwhelm the archive. As the proliferation of scholarship on COVID-19 indicates, we as a discipline are in midst of canon-making. The challenge and opportunity is to ensure that this canon reflects the diversely situated voices of the STS community. 
This panel hopes to offer a precursory corrective to that potentially limited theorizing of COVID-19 through the Euro-American lens, by offering new methodological, practical, and theoretical spaces from which we can see and think about this pandemic. Kuan-Hsing Chen in Asia as Method mobilized an intellectual trajectory that encouraged theoretical moorings that were focused on the diversity of Asian histories and presents as a way to explain Asia. Thinking about Asia in comparison with other places in Asia, and moving beyond comparison with the ‘global north,’ allows for a nuanced way to think about COVID-19. 
In the spirit of this years’ 4S theme ‘Practices and Methods in Unequal and Uncertain Worlds’ this open panel invites papers and talks that encourage new and novel theoretical moorings that emerge from spaces that have known inequality and uncertainty through long histories. Papers from feminist, Indigenous, and/or post-colonial scholars, that draw on the details of how COVID-19 shaped policy, practice, and the everyday in Asia-Pacific, that push the boundaries of ‘traditional’ STS, and make space for complicated narratives that reflect the diversity of the Asian-Pacific COVID-19 experience are welcomed.

Building from the work of feminist science and technology studies, abolitionist scholarship (Wang 2018), studies of racial capitalism (Robinson 1983), and historical and sociological studies of psychiatry, social services, and the prison industrial complex (Roberts 2001, Metzl 2010, Ryan Hatch 2019, Raz 2020, Smtih 2020), panelists will explore the connective tissue between the prison and the asylum, probing the practices, histories, expertise and apparatuses within the mental health care professions and other social services (from psychiatry, psychology, psychotherapy, and beyond) that knit together the carceral with the bioemdical. 
We invite papers that approach topics such as:
The role of digital, computational, and pharmaceutical technologies (e.g. electronic monitoring, predictive AI, listening tools, psychotropic drugs) in extending, fortifying, or disrupting the carceral dimensions of the psy-disciplines, particularly as they impact racialized and marginalized communities 
The intersection of state, corporate, and colonial surveillance networks and mental health care, from institutionalization to self-help and mindfulness movements 
Anti-carceral technologies that point to abolitionist futures for psychiatry beyond bureaucratic or colonial institutions

				Neoliberal health reforms have flown under many banners: structured pluralism; new public management; value-based care. These reforms often involve re-using patient data in resource allocation, population-level analytics, and healthcare and public health administration. Such activities make assumptions about the nature, accuracy, and utility of such data, and often wrongly assume patients’ access to payment. In addition to producing benefits, these reforms have led to harms: algorithmically-crystallized neglect; structural exploitation veiled by market logics; clinician demoralization. Informed consent – which could have been preserved or extended through models for accountable, privacy-preserving multi-party sharing of data that integrate bioethical principles – has arguably been eroded through the integration of data infrastructures. Technology companies have taken the COVID-19 pandemic as an occasion for expansion with minimal oversight, often encouraged by new regulations designed to facilitate the release of medical records from the health system to mobile and Web services chosen by ostensibly well-informed health consumers. New forms of profiteering and malfeasance may emerge, for which governments and professions are unprepared. 
This open panel aims to deepen conversations between health informatics and STS, to clarify how critical inquiry can enrich health informatics practice and policy. We aim to deepen conversations about data justice in interoperable health systems and to make inroads that lead to material benefits for those neglected and exploited under neoliberalized health regimes. In addition to critical qualitative and humanistic inquiry, we welcome submissions that use quantitative and computational methods in a critical fashion, and speculative submissions that envision transformative futures.

				STS is approaching something of a relational turn. This is, in large part, a result of the recent rise of new materialisms and their attempts to extend accounts of social relations to nonhuman agents and material forces, to frequently generative ends. However, this work lands with a particular valence in settler colonial contexts, where Indigenous scholars have offered astute critiques of the ways that such projects come close to re-enacting non-Western ontologies of interconnection, though judiciously scrubbed of any metaphysical claims or acknowledgements of colonial legacies (Tallbear 2015, Todd 2016). Accordingly, while in both protests and paywalled papers alike, there is a call to acknowledge the material relations between human and nonhuman worlds, there is not a shared agreement of what this might mean in its particulars. If relations provide, to some degree, both a theory of everything and a site of continued incommensurate social claims, then the call for simply more relationality is likely to quickly find its limits. How then, do we proceed?
This panel finds its answer through projects of categorization. It highlights papers that develop analytic vocabularies capable of distinguishing between different relational forms and effects to better assess how contrasting relational frameworks work to admit certain forms of connection while insulating themselves from others. Grounded in both new research and scholarly engagements with the growing literature on relational methods and imperatives, the panel seeks to intervene in this quickly developing theoretical turn to seed further and more fruitful relational analytics.

				Over the past two hundred years of industrialization, societies and scientists have struggled to keep track of the safety profiles of chemicals, both the long-used ones and the constant stream of new chemicals, used in agriculture and homes and in cosmetics, supplements, and pharmaceuticals. More often than not, when chemicals appear on the market, their risk profiles are poorly understood and are used for many years before evidence of harm
emerges. Knowledge of toxicities is generated by researchers working in a range of disciplines, each of which producing field-specific knowledge with their own measurement techniques, resulting in their own “agential cut” (Barad 2007). Measurements of chemical toxicities furthermore change over time. In the early twentieth century, animal studies were used to define threshold levels below which substances were deemed safe, while nowadays, it is recognized that some chemicals can disrupt endocrine systems and cause cancers even at very low levels of exposure. Overall there is very little knowledge on the effects of the multitude of chemicals that make up our every-day lives (Murphy 2008). Thus, what we know about entangled toxicities of chemicals is partial and in flux.  How can we make poorly understood slow toxicities visible, and what are the challenges in doing so? We seek contributions that analyze how policymakers, researchers, artists, and activists confront these challenges, including how they seek to make the entangled toxicities visible and intervene to prevent toxicities. We invite both theoretical and methodological papers on these critical questions.

				How do you cultivate good practices, relationships, and things in an environment of toxicants, toxic politics, and toxic relationalities? How do toxic production systems–based on extractivism, colonialism, and plantation capitalism–foment new forms of sustainability that cannot be excised from their deadly foundations? This open call examines urgent tensions between toxic legacies and hopeful futures when it comes to so-called renewable energies, green/blue/bio-economies, waste management systems, and sustainable agriculture/aquaculture. Such hopeful alternatives to unsustainable production systems hold within them the possibility of working towards a “Greater Good,” however, “goodness” is largely built on toxic colonial and capitalist foundations that are rendered invisible through sustainability discourse. In other words, in making sustainable things or practices, toxicities in many forms are in fact often sustained. This panel will therefore investigate the ways scientists, investors, and producers in the agricultural, aquacultural, and waste sectors build on toxic legacies as they seek to render generative material processes–such as photosynthesis, bioremediation, and fermentation–into sustainable tools. We encourage papers that empirically illuminate how social systems and material processes together shore up, generate, and maintain toxicity. Such investigations will open space to question whether and how good relations could be cultivated out of toxic relationships without assuming that toxicity can be entirely expunged. The overall aim of this open panel is thus to critically address how sustainable processes depend on toxic production systems, as a first step towards activating better ways of living amid toxicity.

				Major changes are underway within the pharmaceutical sector that are associated with shifts in research, innovation and business models from blockbuster products intended for large patient populations to more niche products designed for smaller, more targeted populations. Innovation is underway in  how drugs are being researched and developed, and how they are being manufactured, used, evaluated, licensed and paid for. While some of these changes are tied to genomics and the rise of personalized medicine, others result of patient activism and disease politics. These technical and political developments put pressure on public regulators and payers, resulting in novel forms of governance, including the use of real world data and conditional reimbursement.
This panel builds on STS scholarship on the socio-technical production of pharmaceutical knowledge, as well as its material and biopolitical impacts.  We invite papers from a range of international perspectives that critically analyze these transformations, as well as those that highlight forms of alternative pharmaceutical practices and methods that are more sustainable and offer more just and equitable access to treatments. Topics may include but are not limited to:
– Forms of open pharmaceutical innovation
– Industry dynamics and changing business models
– Patient groups and new forms of knowledge production
– R&D partnerships across public, not-for-profit and/or private sector
– Drug repurposing and off-label use

				Extending ongoing dialogue about Transnational STS in recent years, this panel invites scholars located around the globe to share their work conceptualizing, practicing and extending Transnational STS in different ways. In particular, we are interested in drawing out and foregrounding student experiences in various STS programs and organizations (including formations outside of the academy) to reflect on the paradigms and programmes in which we are training and being trained. This year’s conference theme raises important questions about turning a critical eye to the oppressions maintained within technoscience, especially neoliberal university structures. Attending to the transgenerational character of collaborative relations, both within and beyond the university, sets up the possibility to dismantle violent, entrenched practices and build alliances that span age and temporal contexts. Inspired by critical university studies and radical education thinkers like Paulo Freire, Gregory Bateson, and Gayatri Spivak, we call for transgenerational and transformative listening and dialogue and are interested in learning about experiments and tactics that help build “good relations” across geographic, disciplinary and generational hierarchies. Leveraging conversations from last year’s three-part panel on Transnational STS (find abstracts at https://stsinfrastructures.org/content/open-panel-4seasst-2020-transnational-sts-theories-practices-and-pedagogies), rather than approaching “transnational” as an ideal temporal-spatial universalism to be achieved, we question and reflect on the use value of the analytic of the “nation-state” when studying technoscientific developments across contexts. Layering such transnational sensibilities with transgenerational listening promises fresh perspectives on the character and use of STS at varying scales and locations. This panel furthers work being undertaken by the Student Section of the Society for the Social Studies of Science (6S) to develop a reference database of STS programs around the world with the aim of fostering greater transnational collaborations and network building. The panel will be chaired by Kim Fortun and Sharon Traweek will serve as discussant.
Contributions may address, among others, the following questions:
How are transnational student research and collaborative relations formed and organized? What kinds of tactics have they leveraged? How do research networks set collaborative agendas and what enables them to sustain over time?
What infrastructures can support transnational and transgenerational STS collaborations, particularly those that extend beyond the academy?
What tactics do STS programs use to stay tuned to both local and transnational contexts and issues?
What pedagogical philosophies (explicitly or implicitly) orient differently situated STS programs, and to what effect?
How does transnational STS contribute to STS teaching and pedagogy? How can transnational STS add to local efforts in engaging with multiple publics, decision-makers, scientists, activists, and other related actors?

				Digitalization, datafication, algorithmization, and the myriad applications of AI have the potential to transform our societies. This panel examines the transformation by focusing on the concept and idea of transparency. Algorithmic governance of societies, and the governance of algorithmic decision making itself, pose new kinds of challenges to (e.g.) legitimacy of governance, accountability and protection of rights. These challenges have lately been the subject of European Union policy and regulation, with the General Data Protection Regulation emphasizing transparency as the central principle and criterion in the processing of personal data. Indeed, in policy and politics, transparency is often seen as a panacea to the woes of democratic governance. However, at present it is unclear what transparency does and can achieve in the context of algorithmic governance, or what transparency exactly refers to. Thus, what are we talking about when we talk about transparency in algorithmic governance? 
Though the organizers of this panel work at the interface of sociolegal and STS scholarship and critical algorithm studies, we welcome all contributions that straddle any institutional, professional and disciplinary boundaries and discuss the social, legal and technological practice of transparency. 
Thus, presentations can discuss transparency and algorithmic governance (e.g.) in the following contexts:
·      legal regulation of algorithmic governance,
·      policy,
·      new forms of expertise or expert advisory groups,
·      technological and social aspects of AI,
·      effects of transparency for epistemic subjects,
·      technological competence and its distribution in society. 
We welcome theoretical, legal and empirical analyses and case studies. ",197,Transparency, algorithmic governance, datafication,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Big Data, AI and Machine Learning",Governance and Public Policy,Other

				This panel will bring together scholars researching trauma and stress from biosocial perspectives. Trauma-informed approaches are often positioned as a gold standard of care across biomedical, therapeutic, carceral and policy domains. Historical trauma frameworks have long been central to collective identity and politics among Indigenous, Black and other racially marginalised communities, and have gained momentum through recent anti-racist and anti-colonial movements like Black Lives Matter and Idle No More. Research fields like social epidemiology, critical public health and biological anthropology have explored how trauma and stress “get inside” the body to shape health disparities (e.g. “minority stress”; “weathering” [Geronimus 1992]). Recently, research on the developmental origins of health and disease and epigenetics is redefining trauma as an exposure with a heritable trace (Dubois&Guaspare 2020), raising new questions about ancestral memory and reproductive politics.
We invite scholars from various disciplines to explore how trauma and stress are enacted biosocially through human experience, activist tactics, government policy and scientific knowledge. How are trauma and stress defined, studied and reformulated across these arenas? What are the social and political stakes of trauma-informed practices? What forms of temporality, identity and justice do they produce?
Possible contributions may consider:
–	Trauma and stress in postgenomic science
–	Intergenerational trauma
–	Trauma-informed care in health, education or criminal justice
–	Intersectional and embodied accounts of stress and trauma (e.g. gender and medical racism)
–	Theorising trauma and stress (e.g. necropolitics, slow violence, new materialisms, decolonial research, geontopower)
–	Trauma and biomedicalisation

				Over the past decade, phrases like “data is the new oil”, “numbers speak for themselves”, and “data-driven approaches” have featured prominently in industry and government discourse alike. Personalized recommendations and targeted ads are products of data-driven ‘innovation’. Governments are turning towards data-driven policy making, targeted service delivery, and ubiquitous surveillance (Engin & Treleaven, 2019). International development agencies have opted consumer-data as a proxy for the more time-consuming and expensive surveys to make populations visible to them (Taylor & Broeders, 2015).  This pervasive datafication calls for critical reflections on how data-driven approaches shape what we know, how we know and also what we do not get to know. 
While quantifying people’s lives is not new, with technological capabilities for more complex interlinking, and much faster analysis of large datasets, reliance on data-driven understanding of the world has intensified. Against this backdrop of increasing datafication and claims of data objectivity and infallibility, this panel aims to examine the implications of using data as a means of knowing – about customers, patients, audiences, citizens and communities.
We invite papers that critically reflect on the shifts in the constitution of knowledge and processes of knowing by engaging with the scope, limits and nature of datafied knowledge in domains such as governance, public health, policing, news, activism, research, finance, entertainment, development projects and others. The broader objective of the panel is to better understand the political and social ramifications of data-driven approaches to knowledge construction on our perception and interpretation of the world around us.

				Questioning the brain drain circulation and the scientific diasporas approaches (Gaillard & Gaillard, 1998; Meyer, 2011; Pellegrino, 2001, 2013), we criticize the supposedly causal relation between the development (Vinck, 2014), the scientific internationalization policies (Rivero y Trejo, 2020), and the knowledge production.
That brain circulation is configured in an unequal way, especially when we look at the circulation between central and peripherals countries. On one hand, a subordinated integration (Kreimer, 2010) could determine the peripheral countries’ scientific agendas, due to the empirical applications of the central countries laboratories’ investigation lines, where former scientific were instructed.
On the other hand, the institutional and epistemological frames that found scientific policies and research representations don’t picture enough the deep transformations of the scientific practices, the intellectual work and the knowledge production of a world inhabited by a profound conscience of uncertainty and vulnerability. Both characteristics shape the contemporary knowledge field, because of the mobility and labor instability that it assumes and supposes (Broitman, 2020; Le Marec, 2020).
As these formative experiences could configure different uses in knowledge production, works concerning 1) strategies oriented to labor reinsertion, 2) individual preoccupations, 3) political claims, 4) internationalization and others topics related are welcome.

We are interested in applications of speculative fictions exploring ideas of stewardship that translate or extend practices as applied terrestrially or to an increased human influence in the cosmos. We invite papers that reflect on the role and utility that speculative fiction can play in fostering pedagogical and/or research applications in regards to stewardship and responsible innovation. We seek examples of applications of speculative fiction in various contexts (e.g. in the classroom, as public engagement, research, etc.). By stewardship, we refer to both the environmental stewardship of the earth, as well as within an extraterrestrial contexts (eg. habitation on the ISS, the moon, Mars, etc). We seek papers that speak to the relationship between nature and stewardship (i.e. in terms of reflecting on whether outer space is part of nature). 
This panel centers on reflections regarding how speculative fictions and the lens of environmental stewardship can contribute to an eudaimonic, flourishing society, through a lens of an ethics of care or other ethical frameworks. We welcome papers that respond to how the lens of speculative fiction speaks to themes of environmental stewardship and responsible innovation that open up dialogue around the question “what is nature” and “who is responsible”.  While we use space as an example, we invite papers on a wide variety of topics, ranging from AI to biotechnology and beyond.

				On June 9th, 2019, so-called “design ethicist” and former Google employee Tristan Harris, tweeted: “We need a new field of ‘Society & Technology Interaction’ (or STX).” The tweet caused a maelstrom of reactions from STS scholars and others, who used it as a classic example of the willful ignorance of industrial actors towards decades-old scholarship about their field. Harris eventually deleted the tweet and apologized for “a poor choice of words”: “We want to see a world where the field of design…[is] equipped with an applied view of the fields you mention.” This panel explores how this work is already being done and how it might continue.
Arguably, Design Studies has been an STS field for over 35 years: in 1984, Hillier, Musgrove, and O’Sullivan argue that architecture should be taught alongside scientific philosophers such as Popper, Kuhn, and Lakatos; five years later, design theorist Victor Margolin uses Dickson, Feyerabend, and Aronowitz to argue that “we cannot conceive of any theory of design…independent of a theory of society” (1989); and in 2015, Cameron Tonkinwise argues that Actor-Network Theory is inherently designerly.
Design educators teach students to design artifacts which are necessarily embedded within sociotechnical and technoscientific systems. What, then, can STS offer the design academy? How can students connect their studio work with its broader implications? We aim to assemble a panel of teacher-scholars who will directly address pedagogical approaches.

				Most contemporary policy fields are deeply intertwined with tools of ordering that also act as tools of valuation. Such procedures often involve the translation of qualities into quantities, concomitantly with the ascription of economic value. Think only of the quantification of polluting emissions and their pricing on carbon markets, the infection numbers that detect the distribution of Covid-19 across and within countries and the calculation of the cost of life years saved, measures of scientific output through the number of publications, patents or start-ups created, cost-benefit analyses that balance risks and benefits. Such numbering techniques do not only quantify, they also do valuations: they take part in producing the worth of the objects they detect and measure. We invite papers that address such tools of valuation, their emergence and ways of operating. What are the relations between the tools involved and the entities they work upon? How to interrogate the complex relations between the ‘quantifiable’ and the ‘valuable’, the promises such tools of valuation live by and the good and the, sometimes, troubling relations they produce? What are the relations between the material and the semiotic elements such tools are very often composed by and the complex interplay between the tools of valuation and the larger valuation machineries of which they are very often part? Which modes of governing are these tools part of, and how do they relate to their specific politics?

				Anything that has both direction and magnitude can be described as a vector. Take a billiard ball. Standing still, it is just a ball. But set in motion, it has new capacities and potentials: it can hit another ball on the table; it can rearrange the board. Or take a mosquito. Alone, it is an insect—ostensibly an isolated being. But once it has been infected with a pathogen, it can spread disease, cause death, change worlds. Toxics, dust storms, super-spreaders: all of these are vectors, too. What can we learn by taking up vectors as objects of analysis? That is, what can we learn by looking at our research objects in their vector forms? 
We invite contributions from scholars working on a range of objects (medical, environmental, mathematical, aesthetic, political, or otherwise) who are interested in exploring those objects in motion. How do they become relational pathways—entities that spread, link up, cross scales, and expand from points of origin? Can vectors be both problems and blueprints for solving them? Can they be both objects and methods? Does rethinking the object-as-vector invite us to make connections that are otherwise obscure? And what about the researcher-as-vector? Covid-19 throws old ethical quandaries about fieldwork into harrowing relief, pressing questions like: what do “good relations” look like when there is not even a pretense of separation or neutrality? When the scholar-body poses an explicit risk, and is itself at risk, how should that change the ways we go about our work?

				These are unprecedented times, or so we are told through COVID-19 communications articulated by global health institutions and national governments. Such exceptionalism foregrounds the significance of the current crisis – its bodily and economic impacts, the global and local inequities that have materialized and the myriad meanings it has created. Yet this exceptionalism, in practices and discourses, also gives rise to hierarchies of knowledge production. Ontologies and epistemologies advanced by global and national health responses construe the virus as a discrete, measurable entity. Such dominant framing might connect COVID-19 with other epidemics, as for instance HIV, but disarticulates the viral from local marginalized knowledges and modes of worlding.  Consequently, borders are erected – geopolitically, between bodies and knowledge generating disciplines, temporalities, and across socio-economic differences – in the name of exceptionalism. 
What queer, Indigenous, and decolonial knowledges, histories, embodied effects and meanings can be highlighted if we understand that COVID-19 and other epidemics are exceptional through the particular relations they put in place or displace? This panel doesn’t dismiss COVID-19’s local and global significance, but instead invites contributors to inhabit virality’s exceptionalism in relational terms: querying science’s entanglements with politics; reconceiving intimacies and viral transmission; positing other temporalities and post-COVID futurity narratives.  
We invite papers that consider:

Instead of taking this dichotomy for granted, this panel suggests that scholars can attend to the complexities of vision as distributed across devices, networks, data infrastructures and the human eye. We propose to expand human vision by ethnographically attending to its relationality and entanglements.
To do so, we call for generous methods (M’charek forthcoming), i.e. methods which, instead of taming their research objects, allow for carefully attending to the intricacies of vision.  Multimodal research designs allow for such multiplications, cross-modality, and invisualities (Mackenzie and Munster 2019). Yet by theorizing through making (e.g. through audio-visual, coding or other practices) how can they help us situate technologies of vision in their complex and messy networks? This panel invites experimental and multimodal ethnographic accounts of seeing that go beyond the somatic body and even the realm of the visual. We contend that by empirically situating technologies of vision in concrete practices we can effectively explore the politics they articulate. By employing a cross-modal (Ballestero 2019) approach to vision we encourage papers that challenge the separation of human from the non-human as well as to move beyond the panoptic visualizations that dominate the scholarship on securitization and military technologies.

				Local health traditions have largely been devalued in the biomedical understanding of health and disease. This approach fails to recognise that a population can be ‘self-reliant’ in its health care practices, a philosophy, and perspective that is held within non-Western health cultures such as the ancient tradition of Ayurveda (Mathpati et al., 2020). Among the unintended yet damaging consequences of Cartesian divides (traditional medicine/biomedicine, science/people), the overuse of drugs such as antibiotics and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) have become critical matters of public/global health agendas. The coronavirus pandemic demonstrates that biomedical disease control alone is insufficient when considering the overall health and wellbeing of a population. For example, in the absence of appropriate (health)care, dietary changes along with supplements from various medical traditions have not only emerged as effective cures and remedies for healing from (long) Covid; they have also become biopolitical tools to self-manage vulnerabilities and inequalities (i.e.healthcare, employment, and childcare in convalescence).
This open panel invites scholars to engage with local, traditional, and profane healing knowledge-practices as an alternative, collective, and sustainable health care approaches as well as biopolitical tools of individual responsibility. By focusing on how to build on and establish ‘good relations’ between (1) local and traditional medicines and biomedicine and (2) lay and professional expertise, this panel addresses pluralistic ways of healing practices and methods in unequal and uncertain worlds.
Themes might include but are not limited to:
-Status of knowledges (local, traditional, profane)
-Traditional and complementary medicine in pandemic
-Non-western knowledge practices around the body and healing
-Self-body-world and biopolitics
-Neopagan rituals, women, and magic
-Citizen science and eHealth activism initiatives
-Health inequalities and ‘reverse’ innovation",208,folk healing, local and traditional medicine, biomedicine, inequalities, biopolitics,NA,NA,NA,Decolonial STS,Medicine and Healthcare,Social Justice/Social Movement

				Recent scholarship on mining and drilling (Appel et al. 2015, Klinger 2017), the anthropocene (Yusoff 2018), urban infrastructure (Anand 2017), maritime logistics (Starosielski 2015, Campling & Colás 2021), the transit of toxins (Murphy 2013), and the disposal of bodies (Krupar 2018) theorizes the politics of sub-surface worlds. Bringing these depths into view has centered new spaces, scales, materials, and relations. Yet the concept of depth itself, and the responsibilities that attend its investigation, have not been sufficiently examined. 
Depth is more than a simple spatial signifier or linguistic trope. Thinking with and beyond verticality (Graham and Hewitt 2012), volumetric space (Weizman 2007, Elden 2013, Billé 2018), and metaphor (McKittrick 2018, Shalem 2017), we want to suggest that the deeps constitute a semiotic landscape that is resolutely material but always exceeds conventional materialist readings. Deep spaces matter: they are simultaneously material and meaningful. We seek papers that engage critically and creatively with the mattering of chthonic landscapes, defined broadly.
Encoded in the concept of depth are all kinds of latent associations and meanings. As such, we may speak of deep time, deep sleep, deep ecology, deep learning, the deep state, skin deep, diving deep, depth of character, depth of perception, depth of field, depth of meaning, etc. How, we ask, are these (and many other) conceptualizations of depth tied to the deep places of the earth? And if, as Spivak teaches us, thought must be “written on the planet as planet” (2012: 349), how does thinking operate beneath the planetary surface?

				This panel seeks to explore how the language of civil rights and freedoms can be translated in the language and materiality of infrastructures and what are the complexities that arise from this process. As Keller Easterling (2014) writes “changes to the globalizing world are being written, not in the language of law and diplomacy, but rather in the language of infrastructure”. From Internet routing protocols to network architecture solutions, infrastructures “set the invisible rules that govern the spaces of our everyday lives” (Ibid). 
The panel aims to unveil the different types of organizations and configurations in which the ’embedding’ of freedoms into infrastructure takes shape, from the arenas of more ‘traditional’ Internet governance led by specialized institutions and often promoted through international technical standards, to grassroots, local and activist-led initiatives such as alternative routing protocols, decentralized and local networks or experimental messaging tools. We also seek to unveil the variety of motivations subtending these phenomena, ranging from specific and institutionalized political agendas to technical innovation and experimentation, often linked to particular imaginaries and visions of society.
We accept innovative and interdisciplinary research pieces (both work-in-progress and advanced papers) that experiment with methodologies, but also welcome practitioners, activists and journalists who propose a critical insiders’ take on the “infrastructure-wired rights”. This panel seeks to build upon a previous conversation taking place at Privacy Camp 2021.
