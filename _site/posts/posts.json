Last year I did a deep dive into the ACS commuting data, as it was the first year that the data was released after the onset of the pandemic. And indeed: Huge changes in commuting, especially an explosion in working from home, could be seen. However, commuting is only one part of our transportation landscape, and this year my review will also look at several other indicators of the state of biking in Madison, as well as making comparisons with some other US cities and national trends.\r\nCommuting data from ACS: Fewer people work from home; driving and transit usage are up\r\nAfter an unprecedented rise in working from home between 2019 and 2021, some people returned to the office in 2022. The share of working from home declined from over 26% in 2021 to about 20% in 2021. The two modes with the largest increases were driving (58% to 62%; increase within margin of error) and transit (3% to 5%). All other modes didn’t change much at all, and any changes were well within the margins of error. Biking ended up at a miserable 2.6% (+/- 0.7%), the lowest percentage in the data reaching back to 2010.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\nlibrary(tmap)\r\nlibrary(sf)\r\nlibrary(tidycensus)\r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\r\nlibrary(gt)\r\nlibrary(ggtext)\r\nlibrary(extrafont)\r\nlibrary(hrbrthemes)\r\nloadfonts(device = \"win\", quiet = TRUE) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# variables <- load_variables(dataset = \"acs1/subject\", year = \"2021\")\r\n\r\nget_msn_mode_share <- function(year) {\r\n  acs_data <- get_acs(year = year, survey = \"acs1\", table = \"S0801\", geography = \"place\", state = 55, cache_table=T)\r\n  acs_data |> \r\n    filter(NAME == \"Madison city, Wisconsin\") |> \r\n    mutate(year = year)\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n# variable_readable = case_when(\r\n#   variable == \"S0801_C01_002\" ~ \"Drive\",\r\n#   variable == \"S0801_C01_009\" ~ \"Transit\",\r\n#   variable == \"S0801_C01_010\" ~ \"Walk\",\r\n#   variable == \"S0801_C01_011\" ~ \"Bike\",\r\n#   variable == \"S0801_C01_013\" ~ \"Work from home\",\r\n#   variable == \"S0801_C02_002\" ~ \"Drive, male\",\r\n#   variable == \"S0801_C02_009\" ~ \"Transit, male\",\r\n#   variable == \"S0801_C02_010\" ~ \"Walk, male\",\r\n#   variable == \"S0801_C02_011\" ~ \"Bike, male\",\r\n#   variable == \"S0801_C02_013\" ~ \"Work from home, male\",\r\n#   variable == \"S0801_C03_002\" ~ \"Drive, female\",\r\n#   variable == \"S0801_C03_009\" ~ \"Transit, female\",\r\n#   variable == \"S0801_C03_010\" ~ \"Walk, female\",\r\n#   variable == \"S0801_C03_011\" ~ \"Bike, female\",\r\n#   variable == \"S0801_C03_013\" ~ \"Work from home, female\",\r\n#   \r\n#   \r\n# )\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmsn_mode_share <- map_dfr(c(2010:2019, 2021:2022), get_msn_mode_share)\r\n\r\nmsn_mode_share <- msn_mode_share |> \r\n  mutate(gender = case_when(str_detect(variable, \"^S0801_C01\") ~ \"total\",\r\n                            str_detect(variable, \"^S0801_C02\") ~ \"male\",\r\n                            str_detect(variable, \"^S0801_C03\") ~ \"female\"),\r\n         mode_readable = case_when(\r\n           str_detect(variable, \"S0801_C0[1-3]_002\") ~ \"Drive\",\r\n           str_detect(variable, \"S0801_C0[1-3]_009\") ~ \"Transit\",\r\n           str_detect(variable, \"S0801_C0[1-3]_010\") ~ \"Walk\",\r\n           str_detect(variable, \"S0801_C0[1-3]_011\") ~ \"Bike\",\r\n           str_detect(variable, \"S0801_C0[1-3]_013\") ~ \"Work from home\"))\r\n        \r\n# data frame for the ggrepel labels on the right of the plot\r\nmsn_mode_share_2022 <-  msn_mode_share |> \r\n  filter(year == 2022 & !is.na(mode_readable))\r\n\r\nmsn_mode_share |> \r\n  filter(!is.na(mode_readable) & gender == \"total\") |> \r\n  group_by(mode_readable, year) |> \r\n  ggplot(aes(year, estimate, color = mode_readable)) +\r\n  geom_line(linewidth = 1.2) +\r\n  hrbrthemes::scale_color_ipsum(\r\n    #name = element_blank()\r\n    ) +\r\n  geom_crossbar(aes(ymin = estimate -

Especially now that many workers are in hybrid work arrangements, there is additional uncertainty about the interpretation of the numbers.\r\nHow does Madison compare to US-wide trends?\r\nIf we look at change over time, it seems like a good idea to ask whether Madison is following a unique path.

While Madison commuters drive less, bike, walk, and bus more than the average US commuter, the trend over time looks similar. And that’s true for the change from 2021 to 2022 as well: Just like in Madison, nationwide working from home went down, and driving and transit rebounded slightly.\r\nHow are other cities doing?\r\nRather than comparing Madison with the US as whole, we can also compare our 2022 numbers with other US cities. Here we see a lot of variability, but when it comes to biking, other places aren’t doing much better. San Francisco and Portland have marginally higher bike commuting rates, and Minneapolis is a little lower than Madison, but they all are within the margin error. New York City is below 2%, and in Milwaukee not even 1 out of 100 workers bike to work.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\nget_place_mode_share <- function(year, places) {\r\n  acs_data <- get_acs(year = year, survey = \"acs1\", table = \"S0801\", geography = \"place\", cache_table=T)\r\n  acs_data |> \r\n    filter(NAME %in% places) |> \r\n    mutate(year = year)\r\n}\r\n\r\nnational_mode_share_2022_total <- national_mode_share_2022 %>% \r\n  filter(gender == \"total\") %>% \r\n  mutate(\r\n    label = case_when(\r\n           mode_readable == \"Drive\" ~ \"<span style='font-family:fa-solid;'>&#xf1b9;<\/span>\",\r\n           mode_readable == \"Transit\" ~ \"<span style='font-family:fa-solid;'>&#xf207;<\/span>\",\r\n           mode_readable == \"Walk\" ~ \"<span style='font-family:fa-solid;'>&#xf554;<\/span>\",\r\n           mode_readable == \"Bike\" ~ \"<span style='font-family:fa-solid;'>&#xf206;<\/span>\",\r\n           mode_readable == \"Work from home\" ~ \"<span style='font-family:fa-solid;'>&#xe066;<\/span>\"\r\n  ),\r\n  NAME = \"US\")\r\n\r\nmode_share_comparison <- get_place_mode_share(2022, c(\"Madison city, Wisconsin\", \"Portland city, Oregon\", \"Minneapolis city, Minnesota\", \"San Francisco city, California\", \"Milwaukee city, Wisconsin\", \"New York city, New York\"))\r\n\r\nmode_share_comparison <- mode_share_comparison |> \r\n  mutate(gender = case_when(str_detect(variable, \"^S0801_C01\") ~ \"total\",\r\n                            str_detect(variable, \"^S0801_C02\") ~ \"male\",\r\n                            str_detect(variable, \"^S0801_C03\") ~ \"female\"),\r\n         mode_readable = case_when(\r\n           str_detect(variable, \"S0801_C0[1-3]_002\") ~ \"Drive\",\r\n           str_detect(variable, \"S0801_C0[1-3]_009\") ~ \"Transit\",\r\n           str_detect(variable, \"S0801_C0[1-3]_010\") ~ \"Walk\",\r\n           str_detect(variable, \"S0801_C0[1-3]_011\") ~ \"Bike\",\r\n           str_detect(variable, \"S0801_C0[1-3]_013\") ~ \"Work from home\"),\r\n         label = case_when(\r\n           mode_readable == \"Drive\" ~ \"<span style='font-family:fa-solid;'>&#xf1b9;<\/span>\",\r\n           mode_readable == \"Transit\" ~ \"<span style='font-family:fa-solid;'>&#xf207;<\/span>\",\r\n           mode_readable == \"Walk\" ~ \"<span style='font-family:fa-solid;'>&#xf554;<\/span>\",\r\n           mode_readable == \"Bike\" ~ \"<span style='font-family:fa-solid;'>&#xf206;<\/span>\",\r\n           mode_readable == \"Work from home\" ~ \"<span style='font-family:fa-solid;'>&#xe066;<\/span>\"\r\n         ),\r\n         NAME = str_remove(NAME, \" city\")) |> \r\n    filter(!is.na(mode_readable) & gender == \"total\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\nlibrary(showtext)\r\n\r\nshowtext_auto()\r\n# First argument = name in R\r\n# Second argument = path to .otf-file\r\nfont_add('fa-reg', 'fonts/Font_Awesome_6_Free-Regular-400.otf')\r\nfont_add('fa-brands', 'fonts/Font_Awesome_6_Brands-Regular-400.otf')\r\nfont_add('fa-solid', 'fonts/Font_Awesome_6_Free-Solid-900.otf')\r\nfont_add(\"Arial Narrow\", \"C:/Windows/Fonts/ARIALN.TTF\")\r\nfont_add_google(\"Roboto Condensed\", \"Roboto Condensed\")\r\n\r\np <- rbind(mode_share_comparison, national_mode_share_2022_total) %>% \r\n  mutate(name_by_bike_share = fct_relevel(NAME, c(\"San Francisco, California\", \r\n                        \"Portland, Oregon\",\r\n                        \"Madison, Wisconsin\", \r\n                        \"Minneapolis, Minnesota\", \r\n                        \"New York, New York\",\r\n                        \"Milwaukee, Wisconsin\",\r\n                        \"US\"))) %>% \r\n  group_by(mode_readable, name_by_bike_share) |> \r\n  ggplot(aes(name_by_bike_share, estimate, color = mode_readable, label = label)) +\r\n    geom_richtext(size = 8, label.colour = NA, fill = NA) +\r\n    geom_point(size = 2, color = \"red\") +\r\n  hrbrthemes::scale_color_ipsum() +\r\n  scale_fill_discrete() +\r\n  hrbrthemes::theme_ipsum() +\r\n  #

Rather than only counting commutes, these counters capture all bike trips.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\nshowtext.auto(enable = FALSE)\r\ndetach(\"package:showtext\", unload = TRUE)\r\ncounts_2022 <- readxl::read_excel(\"data/EcoCounter_2022.xlsx\", skip = 3,\r\n                   col_names = c(\"time_count\", \"count_cap_city\", \"count_sw_path\")) |> \r\n  mutate(date_count = floor_date(time_count, unit = \"hours\")) |> \r\n  summarize(across(starts_with(\"count_\"), ~ sum(.x, na.rm = T)), .by = date_count) |> \r\n  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with(\"count_\"), names_to = \"location\", values_to = \"count_hourly\") |> \r\n  mutate(location = case_when(location == \"count_cap_city\" ~ \"Cap City at North Shore\",\r\n                              location == \"count_sw_path\" ~ \"SW Path at Randall\"),\r\n         dayofweek = wday(date_count),\r\n         weekendind = ifelse(dayofweek %in% c(1:5), \"weekday\", \"weekend\"),\r\n         month_count = month(date_count, label = T, abbr = T)) \r\n\r\n\r\n# code reused from https://github.com/vgXhc/madison_bike_counts/blob/master/analysis.R\r\n\r\n##get bike counter data\r\ncc_counts <- read_csv(\"data/Eco-Totem_Capital_City_Trail_Bike_Counts(3).csv\", col_types = \"ci-\") %>% mutate(location = \"Cap City at North Shore\")\r\nsw_counts <- read_csv(\"data/Eco-Totem_Southwest_Path_Bike_Counts(2).csv\", col_types = \"ci-\") %>% mutate(location = \"SW Path at Randall\")\r\n#combine two counter locations\r\ncounts <- bind_rows(cc_counts, sw_counts)\r\n#some data prep for counts\r\ncounts2 <- counts %>% \r\n  drop_na %>% \r\n  mutate(date_count = mdy_hm(Count_Date), #fix date and time\r\n         location = as.factor(location),\r\n         # Count = ifelse(Count == 0, 1, Count), #convert 0 counts to 1 to allow log transform\r\n         # log_count = log(Count), #create value for log of count\r\n         dayofweek = wday(date_count),\r\n         weekendind = ifelse(dayofweek %in% c(1:5), \"weekday\", \"weekend\"),\r\n         month_count = month(date_count, label = T, abbr = T)\r\n         ) |> \r\n  select(-Count_Date) |> \r\n  rename(count_hourly = Count) |> \r\n  filter(date_count < ymd_hms(\"2022-01-01 00:00:00\"))\r\n\r\n\r\nrbind(counts2, counts_2022) |> \r\n  mutate(year_count = year(date_count)) |> \r\n  filter(year_count >= 2016) |> \r\n  summarize(count_annual_by_location = sum(count_hourly), .by = c(location, year_count)) |>\r\n  reframe(location, year_count, count_annual_by_location, count_annual = sum(count_annual_by_location), .by = year_count) |> \r\n  ggplot(aes(year_count, count_annual_by_location, fill = location)) +\r\n  geom_col(position = \"stack\") +\r\n  geom_text(\r\n    aes(label = after_stat(y), group = year_count), \r\n    stat = 'summary', fun = sum, vjust = -.3, family = \"Roboto Condensed\"\r\n  ) +\r\n  ylim(c(0, 1050000)) +\r\n  scale_fill_ipsum(name = \"Location\") +\r\n  hrbrthemes::theme_ipsum() +\r\n  ylab(\"Number of cyclists\") +\r\n  xlab(\"Year\") +\r\n  labs(title = \"Bike counts declined by 24% between 2016 and 2022\",\r\n       subtitle = \"Counts at permanent Eco Counter locations\",\r\n       caption = \"Data: City of Madison\\nVisualization: Harald Kliems\") +\r\n  theme(legend.position = \"right\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThese counts don’t paint a rosy picture for biking either. Since the counters were installed, they have counted fewer and fewer people on bikes. While in 2016 we had almost one million counts, by 2022 that number has declined to less than 750,000.\r\nStreetlight data\r\nThe American Community Survey only counts commutes; the Eco Counters only count at two locations. Streetlight, a private company, promises to provide comprehensive counts for the whole metro area. They do this by using cell phone and other location data and applying various machine learning mechanisms to estimate bike trips. The data and algorithms are proprietary, but research published by Streetlight claims a high correlation between their data and validation counts from permanent bike counters.\r\nIn a recently released report, Streetlight compares 100 US metro areas1 and how cycling activity has changed there compared to 2019, and then between 2020 and 2022. The idea is that during the COVID pandemic many US cities saw a surge in cycling, and now we have an opportunity to see if that surge was sustainable. In terms of growth from 2019 to 2020, the Madison metro area did not see a surge: We ranked 86th out of 100 metro areas in terms of growth. And from 2020 to 2022, Madison fell even further, to 98th place, ahead only of Portland, OR, and Fresno, CA.\r\nHere’s the map showing the change in cycling activity between 2019 and 2022. You can see how Madison (unlabeled on the map) is one of the few metro areas that actually saw a decline during this time period.\r\nBicycle trip growth in the top 100 metro areas, 2019 to 2022A single sign of optimism? BCycle ridership\r\nSo far all we have seen is doom and gloom. Are there any signs for optimism? Yes: The one indicator that has seen growth in the past few years is use of Madison’s bike share system BCycle. I don’t have complete ridership stats over the years, by Madison BCycle shared this graph of March to September ridership over the past 5 years.2\r\nMadison BCycle March to September ridershipAdding up the numbers shows a 3.6% growth from 222,000 trips in 2021 to 230,000 trips in 2022 during the March to September time period. Of course the more exciting part of this graph is the growth in 2023, but hey, this post is about 2022.\r\nWhere does this leave us?\r\nI don’t like it, but it appears that the conclusion for 2022 has to be that it was another lost year for biking in Madison. Yes, compared to most other US cities, there is still a lot of biking, but for many years we have lacked any growth and likely have seen a decline in how many people ride their bikes and how often they do it. This post doesn’t go into possible explanations, but that work needs to be done in order to figure out how we can turn this trend around.\r\n\r\nStreelight appears to use metropolitan statistical areas. It’s important to note that these are much larger than what most people imagine a metro area to be. In the case of Madison, the area encompasses Dane, Columbia, Green and Iowa counties.↩︎\r\nThe BCycle system is open from mid-March to mid-December.↩︎\r\n",

Like with many packages, my motivation came from repeatedly doing the same data cleaning operations, getting annoyed by it, and then writing code to make it less annoying. Now the package is available on CRAN and it’s time for a brief post about the package.\r\nWhat the package does\r\nntdr currently only has one purpose: Retrieve the latest monthly National Transit Database ridership data and provide it in a tidy data format. Rather than downloading an unwieldy Excel file with hundreds of columns, just use the get_ntd() command to get data on ridership and related metrics.\r\nHow do I use the package\r\nThe best place to start is the package’s website, especially the “Get Started” article. The package itself is simple, but the article provides some useful information about the NTD data and its quirks and limitations. Here’s a very simple example to install the package, retrieve bus ridership in Madison, and plot the data:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFeedback appreciated\r\nThis is my very first package, and I appreciate feedback, feature requests and bug reports!\r\nAcknowledgments\r\nThis package would not exist or be on CRAN without the wonderful “R Packages” book by Hadley Wickham and Jennifer Bryan. Writing a package was intimidating for me, but the book systematically walks you through every step of the process and the tools that make the process quite straightforward in the end. Even the submission to CRAN – about which you can read many frustrating stories – turned out to be easy. Just follow the process outlined in the book!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

It’s a great article about the strain that rising rents have put on residents and what the city can and cannot do about it. For rent data, the article relies on a report from Apartment List, a commercial apartment listing platform:\r\n\r\nA national study from Apartment List in March found that rent prices in Madison have jumped 14.1% over the past year and 30.4% since March 2020. It was the fastest-rising rent of any major city in the United States, the study reported. The average one-bedroom apartment in January 2017 rented for $873. In April 2023, that number clocks in at $1,322.\r\n\r\nYou can read more on how Apartment List calculates their numbers here. I was curious how the Apartment List numbers compare to data from the American Community Survey. The American Community Survey provides a lot of data about housing, and we can look at the data going back almost 20 years.\r\nWhat follows are a number of charts about rents and renting in Madison and in other large cities in the US.\r\nRenters\r\nFirst, how many people in Madison actually are renters?\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\nget_renters <- function(acs_year){\r\n  get_acs(\"place\", \r\n          table = \"B25003\", \r\n          year = acs_year, \r\n          survey = \"acs1\",\r\n          summary_var = \"B25003_001\",\r\n          cache_table = TRUE)\r\n}\r\n\r\nyears <- c(2005:2019,2021) # 2020 has no 1y estimates\r\nnames(years) <- years\r\n\r\nrenters <- map_dfr(years, get_renters, .id = \"year\")\r\n\r\nrenters |> \r\n  filter(NAME == \"Madison city, Wisconsin\") |> \r\n  filter(variable == \"B25003_003\") |> \r\n  mutate(renters_pct = estimate / summary_est) |> \r\n  ggplot(aes(as.numeric(year), renters_pct)) +\r\n  geom_line() +\r\n  hrbrthemes::theme_ipsum() +\r\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_percent()) +\r\n  labs(title = \"About half of households in Madison are renters\",\r\n       x = \"year\",\r\n       y = \"renter households\",\r\n       caption = \"Data: American Community Survey 1-year estimates B25003 \\nVisualization: Harald Kliems\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMadison is pretty much split in half: 51% of households rented in 2021.\r\nWe can compare this to the 50 most populous cities in the US:\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# get population\r\npop <- get_acs(\r\n  \"place\",\r\n  table = \"B01003\",\r\n  survey = \"acs1\",\r\n  cache_table = TRUE\r\n)\r\n\r\nlargest_50 <- pop |> \r\n  arrange(desc(estimate)) |> \r\n  head(50) |> \r\n  pull(GEOID)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrenters_50 <- renters |> \r\n  filter(GEOID %in% largest_50 | NAME == \"Madison city, Wisconsin\") |> \r\n  mutate(city = str_replace(NAME, \" city\", \"\")) |> \r\n  filter(variable == \"B25003_003\") |> \r\n  mutate(renters_pct = estimate / summary_est)\r\n\r\nmin_max_cities <- renters_50 |> \r\n  filter(year == 2021) |> \r\n  filter(renters_pct == min(renters_pct) | renters_pct == max(renters_pct)) |> \r\n  pull(city)\r\n  \r\nrenters_50 |> \r\n  ggplot(aes(as.numeric(year), renters_pct, group = city)) +\r\n  geom_line() +\r\n  hrbrthemes::theme_ipsum() +\r\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_percent()) +\r\n  labs(title = \"Percentage of renter households in Madison and 50 most populous US cities\",\r\n       x = \"year\",\r\n       y = \"renter households\",\r\n       caption = \"Data: American Community Survey 1-year estimates B25003 \\nVisualization: Harald Kliems\") +\r\n  xlim(c(2005, 2024)) +\r\n  gghighlight(city %in% c(min_max_cities, \"Madison, Wisconsin\"))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMadison is somewhere in the middle.

The median renter now pays 63% more than they did in 2005. Again, we can compare Madison with the 50 most populous US cities:\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\nrents_50 <- rents |> \r\n  filter(GEOID %in% largest_50 | NAME == \"Madison city, Wisconsin\") |> \r\n  mutate(city = str_replace(NAME, \" city\", \"\"))\r\n\r\nmin_max_rent_cities <- rents_50 |> \r\n  filter(year == 2021) |> \r\n  filter(rent == min(rent) | rent == max(rent)) |> \r\n  pull(city)\r\n  \r\nrents_50 |> \r\n  ggplot(aes(as.numeric(year), rent, group = city)) +\r\n  geom_line() +\r\n  hrbrthemes::theme_ipsum() +\r\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_dollar()) +\r\n  labs(title = \"Rent is lowest in Wichita, highest in San Jose\",\r\n       x = \"year\",\r\n       y = \"median gross rent\",\r\n       caption = \"Data: American Community Survey 1-year estimates B25064 \\nVisualization: Harald Kliems\") +\r\n  xlim(c(2005, 2025)) +\r\n  gghighlight(city %in% c(min_max_rent_cities, \"Madison, Wisconsin\"))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere’s a huge spread in the median rent: In 2021, the median rent in Wichita was about $850, whereas in San Jose it was $2300!\r\nIf we’re interested in change over time, it makes sense to look at an indexed version of this data: We set the rent in the year 2005 to a value of 100 in each of the cities and then look at how that index changes over time.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# function for indexing: \r\nindex_function <- function(x){\r\n  # input: x, a vector\r\n  # output: x_indexed, a vector \r\n  initial <- x[1]\r\n  map_dbl(x, function(x){x/initial * 100})\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrents_50 |> \r\n  group_by(NAME) |> \r\n  mutate(city = str_replace(NAME, \" city\", \"\")) |> \r\n  mutate(rent_index = index_function(rent)) |> \r\n  ggplot(aes(as.numeric(year), rent_index, group = city)) +\r\n  geom_line() +\r\n  scale_y_continuous() +\r\n  xlim(c(2005, 2023))+\r\n  gghighlight::gghighlight(city %in% c(\"Madison, Wisconsin\",\r\n                                       \"Seattle, Washington\",\r\n                                       \"Detroit, Michigan\"), \r\n                           label_params = list(linewidth = 10)) +\r\n  hrbrthemes::theme_ipsum() +\r\n  xlab(\"year\") +\r\n  ylab(\"indexed rent\") +\r\n  labs(title = \"Median rent in Madison compared to 50 largest US cities\",\r\n       subtitle = \"Indexed to 2005 rent\",\r\n       caption = \"Data: American Community Survey 1-year estimates\\nVisualization: Harald Kliems\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs we see above, all cities are on an upward trajectory, but that trajectory is much steeper for some cities than for others: In Seattle, the indexed rent is at 220 in 2021, i.e. people now pay 2.2 times as much as they did in 2005. At the bottom of the chart is Detroit, where rent now is about 1.4 times what is was in 2005. As we already saw in the previous chart, Madison’s increases are at about 1.6 times.\r\nRent and income\r\nLooking at rent alone is not enough. We should also look at income: Rising rents are less of an issue when incomes rise accordingly. (Of course it’s more complicated than that.

This just goes to show that the relationship between rents and incomes is complicated: Yes, rising rent is less of an income when incomes rise accordingly. But rising incomes can also take on the form of an influx of higher-income people and the displacement of folks with lower incomes.\r\nAre you interested in any other rent-related statistics or have questions?

Last week, Metro released GTFS data for the new network. Not only can riders now use Transit or Google Maps to explore how they get from A to B in the new system; it also allows accessibility analyses that compare the network before and after the redesign.\r\nAccessibility analysis is a big topic in planning, and in addition to proprietary tools, there is an open source ecosystem of software products around transit analysis. For this article I use r5r, “an R package for rapid realistic routing on multimodal transport networks (walk, bike, public transport and car). It provides a simple and friendly interface to R5, the Rapid Realistic Routing on Real-world and Reimagined networks, the routing engine developed independently by Conveyal.”\r\nPrerequisites and data\r\nThe minimum requirements for using r5r are a file with OpenStreetMap road network data and a GTFS file for the transit data. The former I downloaded from Protomaps, and the latter is available directly from Metro or via OpenMobilityData.\r\nComparing trip times\r\nOne key promise of the redesign was that it would decrease travel times. r5r allows us to investigate this. I created a list of points-of-interest (POIs) in different parts of town and saved their coordinated in a Google Spreadsheet. Obviously one could choose other POIs—I picked a mix of locations that are important to me, locations that are on the various edges of town, and some that have come up in public debates during the redesign process. It would be easy to add additional POIs and re-run the analysis.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n#read poi coordinates\r\npoi <- googlesheets4::read_sheet(\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TLN77Pks1W5dl-kx55XCi55-bK--EhJ_DeHhrexGR5M/edit?usp=sharing\")\r\n\r\npoi |> gt()\r\n\r\n\r\nid\r\n      lat\r\n      lon\r\n    State Capitol\r\n43.07475\r\n-89.38416UW Hospital\r\n43.07645\r\n-89.43103Sequoya Library\r\n43.05378\r\n-89.45037Henry Vilas Zoo\r\n43.05808\r\n-89.41039Mickey’s Tavern\r\n43.08790\r\n-89.35847Willy St North\r\n43.12771\r\n-89.36300Walmart South Madison\r\n43.04289\r\n-89.35068East Towne Mall\r\n43.12427\r\n-89.30629West High\r\n43.06860\r\n-89.42617DMV West\r\n43.07894\r\n-89.52885Catholic Multicultural Center\r\n43.04605\r\n-89.39332\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\ntmap_mode(\"view\")\r\npoi |> \r\n  sf::st_as_sf(coords = c(\"lon\", \"lat\")) |> \r\n  tm_shape() +\r\n  tm_dots() +\r\n  tm_text(\"id\", auto.placement = TRUE,\r\n          ymod = 1.5)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother choice is about the time of the comparison: Transit frequencies vary a lot by time of day, with more trips during rush hour, fewer trips during the rest of the day, and no service at all between approximately midnight and 6 am. And less service on weekends. For this analysis I randomly picked a Wednesday afternoon, at 2 pm, right after when the redesign goes into effect and one week before. Not peak hour, but also not low-frequency late night or weekend service. One great feature of r5r is that it is possible to analyze departures within time windows. This addresses a limitation of analyzing only a single time point: If we were to choose only 2:00 pm for our analysis, the particular schedules would have a huge impact on the result. For example, if the stop closest to the origin has a bus that comes every half hour, it matters a lot for the total trip time if the bus comes at 1:59 or at 2:01 pm. With a 1:59 departure, we’d just have missed the bus and would only get to start our trip at 2:29 pm. Whereas with a 2:01 departure, there is basically no waiting time, cutting 28 minutes from the trip. r5r allows analysis of departure times for every minute within a given time window. So it will return trip times for 2:00, 2:01, 2:02, …, 2:30 departures and then we can average those times to reduce the bias of choosing only a single time. These averages, then, represent a scenario of spontaneous, unplanned trips: I know where I want to go, I don’t know anything about bus schedules, and I want to leave right now. Again, other choices for analysis are possible.\r\nTrip time results\r\nHere are the results from the analysis in a table. You can sort and filter the table and explore the results. Overall trip times have indeed decreased for many origin/destination pairs. Walk times are more mixed: There are many origin/destination pairs where walk time has increased. This was one of the criticisms about the redesign: For people with limited mobility, these increased walk times could be a problem. But then there are also routes where walk time has decreased. The bottom line: It’s difficult to draw conclusions from the analysis of a set of 11 locations. r5r provides additional analysis capabilities, and in a future post I may return to this topic.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\nSys.setenv(JAVA_HOME=\"c:/Program Files/OpenJDK/jdk-11/\")\r\n\r\noptions(java.parameters = \"-Xmx2G\")\r\nrJava::.jinit()\r\n#rJava::.jcall(\"java.lang.System\", \"S\", \"getProperty\", \"java.version\")\r\n\r\n\r\n# Indicate the path where OSM and GTFS data are stored\r\nr5r_core <- setup_r5(data_path = \"data/\")\r\n\r\nmode <- c(\"WALK\", \"TRANSIT\")\r\nmax_walk_time <- 30 # minutes\r\nmax_trip_duration <- 150 # minutes\r\ndeparture_datetime <- as.POSIXct(\"12-06-2023 14:00:00\",\r\n                                 format = \"%d-%m-%Y %H:%M:%S\")\r\n\r\n# # extract OSM network\r\n# street_net <- street_network_to_sf(r5r_core)\r\n# \r\n# # extract public transport network\r\n# transit_net <- r5r::transit_network_to_sf(r5r_core)\r\n\r\n\r\n#compare trips before and after network redesign\r\ndeparture_datetime_before <- as.POSIXct(\"05-06-2023 14:00:00\",\r\n                                 format = \"%d-%m-%Y %H:%M:%S\")\r\ndeparture_datetime_after <- as.POSIXct(\"12-06-2023 14:00:00\",\r\n                                        format = \"%d-%m-%Y %H:%M:%S\")\r\n\r\n# calculate a travel time matrix\r\nttm_before <-  expanded_travel_time_matrix(r5r_core = r5r_core,\r\n                                    origins = poi,\r\n                                    destinations = poi,\r\n                                    mode = mode,\r\n                                    departure_datetime = departure_datetime_before,\r\n                                    max_walk_time = max_walk_time,\r\n                                    max_trip_duration = max_trip_duration,\r\n                                    time_window = 30,\r\n                                    breakdown = TRUE)\r\n\r\nttm_before <- ttm_before |> \r\n  filter(from_id != to_id) |> \r\n  mutate(origin_destination = paste0(from_id, \" to \", to_id)) |> \r\n  summarize(mean_traveltime_before = mean(total_time),\r\n            mean_walk_time_before = mean(access_time + egress_time),\r\n            mean_transfer_time_before = mean(transfer_time),\r\n            .by = origin_destination)\r\n\r\nttm_after <-  expanded_travel_time_matrix(r5r_core = r5r_core,\r\n                                           origins = poi,\r\n                                           destinations = poi,\r\n                                           mode = mode,\r\n                                           departure_datetime = departure_datetime_after,\r\n                                           max_walk_time = max_walk_time,\r\n                                           max_trip_duration = max_trip_duration,\r\n                                           time_window = 30,\r\n                                          breakdown = TRUE)\r\n\r\nttm_after <- ttm_after |> \r\n  filter(from_id != to_id) |> \r\n  mutate(origin_destination = paste0(from_id, \" to \", to_id)) |> \r\n  group_by(origin_destination) |> \r\n  summarize(from_id,\r\n            to_id,\r\n            mean_traveltime_after = mean(total_time),\r\n            mean_walk_time_after = mean(access_time + egress_time),\r\n            mean_transfer_time_after = mean(transfer_time)) |> \r\n  distinct(origin_destination, .keep_all = TRUE)\r\n\r\nbefore_after <- ttm_before |> \r\n  left_join(ttm_after, by = c(\"origin_destination\")) |> \r\n  mutate(change_total = (mean_traveltime_after-mean_traveltime_before)/abs(mean_traveltime_before),\r\n         change_walk = (mean_walk_time_after-mean_walk_time_before)/abs(mean_walk_time_before),\r\n         change_transfer = (mean_transfer_time_after -

The strength of each estimate improves when the population of agencies reporting in the prior period is larger.\r\n”\r\n\r\nA PowerPoint presentation on using NTD data, states that “Adjusted Monthly Module Data Release Is Adjusted to Support Time-Series Study.” And cautions, “Data from the most-recent Month may be incomplete due to late reporters. Data is subject to change for up to 18 months (or more in rare cases).”\r\nNone of this is very helpful in understanding how the data are being adjusted.\r\nFor an agency like Madison Metro, which as a full reporter is required to report data monthly, it would seem to make sense to just use the raw data.\r\nLet’s compare raw and adjusted:\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\r\nlibrary(ntdr) #install with remotes::install_github(\"https://github.com/vgXhc/ntdr\")\r\nggplot2::theme_set(theme_minimal())\r\nmetro_raw <- get_ntd(agency = \"City of Madison\", data_type = \"raw\", modes = \"MB\", cache = TRUE)\r\nmetro_adjusted <- get_ntd(agency = \"City of Madison\", data_type = \"adjusted\", modes = \"MB\", cache = TRUE)\r\n\r\nmetro_raw <- metro_raw |> \r\n  mutate(data_type = \"raw\")\r\nmetro_adjusted <- metro_adjusted |> \r\n  mutate(data_type = \"adjusted\")\r\n\r\nmetro_all <- rbind(metro_raw, metro_adjusted)\r\n\r\nggplot(metro_all, aes(month, value, color = data_type)) +\r\n  geom_line(alpha = .5) +\r\n  labs(title = \"Madison Metro monthly ridership\") +\r\n  ylab(\"Unlinked passenger trips\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe see that the raw data is not available for the most recent year.\r\nHere’s what the ReadMe tab of the raw data release says:\r\n\r\nThe Monthly module includes a limited set of key indicators reported by transit properties.\r\nData is reported on a monthly basis, by mode and type of service, for a fiscal year.\r\n\r\nAnd further down: “Unlinked Passenger Trips – For the most recent closed-out annual report year.” So the raw data only seem to be made available after a full year has been closed out.\r\nThis is really confusing.\r\nBack to the adjusted data.\r\nBecause I’m really bad at cleaning out my “Downloads” folder, I have several monthly adjusted data files released in different months in 2022.\r\nThis gives us the ability to compare the files and see how large the adjustments being made actually are.\r\nLet’s compare data released for1 March, October, and December of 2022.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\nlibrary(readxl)\r\nbus_dec_22 <- read_excel(\"c:/Users/user1/Downloads/December 2022 Adjusted Database(1).xlsx\", sheet = 3)\r\n\r\nbus_oct_22 <- read_excel(\"C:/Users/user1/Downloads/October 2022 Adjusted Database(1).xlsx\", sheet = 3)\r\n\r\nbus_mar_22 <- read_excel(\"c:/Users/user1/Downloads/March 2022 Adjusted Database.xlsx\", sheet = 3)\r\n\r\nbus_long_dec_22 <- bus_dec_22 %>% \r\n  filter(Agency == \"City of Madison\" & Modes == \"MB\") |> \r\n  pivot_longer(cols = 10:ncol(bus_dec_22), names_to = \"month\", values_to = \"value\") %>% \r\n  mutate(date = my(month),\r\n         month = month(date),\r\n         report_month = \"dec_22\")\r\n\r\n\r\nbus_long_mar_22 <- bus_mar_22 %>% \r\n  filter(Agency == \"City of Madison\" & Modes == \"MB\") |> \r\n  pivot_longer(cols = 10:ncol(bus_mar_22), names_to = \"month\", values_to = \"value\") %>% \r\n  mutate(date = my(month),\r\n         month = month(date),\r\n         report_month = \"mar_22\")\r\n\r\nbus_long_oct_22 <- bus_oct_22 %>% \r\n  filter(Agency == \"City of Madison\" & Modes == \"MB\") |> \r\n  pivot_longer(cols = 10:ncol(bus_oct_22), names_to = \"month\", values_to = \"value\") %>% \r\n  mutate(date = my(month),\r\n         month = month(date),\r\n         report_month = \"oct_22\")\r\n\r\nmetro_comp <- rbind(bus_long_dec_22, bus_long_oct_22, bus_long_mar_22)\r\n\r\nmetro_comp|> \r\n  ggplot(aes(date, value, color = report_month)) +\r\n  geom_line() +\r\n  scale_color_discrete(\"Data release\") +\r\n  ylab(\"Unlinked passenger trips\") +\r\n  labs(title = \"Comparing NTD monthly adjusted data releases\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe three lines overlap nicely for any data prior to about 2020.\r\nLet’s zoom in on the more recent data:\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\nmetro_comp |> \r\n  filter(date > ymd(\"2020-01-01\")) |> \r\n  ggplot(aes(date, value, color = report_month)) +\r\n  geom_line() +\r\n  ylab(\"Unlinked passenger trips\")+\r\n  labs(title = \"Comparing NTD monthly adjusted data releases\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most obvious discrepancy is between the data released for March 2022 and the October and December releases: The March release starts diverging in January 2021 and is much lower, especially in the second half of 2021.\r\nThe October and December releases appear quite similar, but if you squint, you can see small differences.\r\nWe can calculate and plot these differences:\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\nmetro_comp |> \r\n  pivot_wider(names_from = \"report_month\", values_from = \"value\") |> \r\n  mutate(diff_mar_oct = mar_22 - oct_22,\r\n         diff_mar_dec = mar_22 - dec_22,\r\n         diff_oct_dec = oct_22- dec_22) |> \r\n  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with(\"diff_\"), names_to = \"report_date\", values_to = \"difference\") |> \r\n  filter(report_date == \"diff_oct_dec\" & date > ymd(\"2020-01-01\")) |> \r\n  ggplot(aes(date, difference)) +\r\n  geom_col() +\r\n  labs(title = \"Ridership difference December and October 2022 NTD releases\") +\r\n  ylab(\"Unlinked passenger trip difference\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes, there are differences for 2022, but the differences are fairly small compared to overall ridership.\r\nConclusion\r\nAdjusted monthly NTD data is indeed adjusted from one month to another.\r\nWhether that adjustment is because of data revisions from the reporting agency or something that FTA does (or both) is unclear.\r\nThe adjustments affect primarily the most recent data, and they can be large or small.\r\nIt is possible that the COVID shock to ridership had an outsize influence on the adjustments being made.\r\nThese conclusions are based on my looking at the data for one specific agency; I cannot say if they hold true for other transit agencies.\r\nI also only look at ridership data.\r\nThe monthly NTD releases also include vehicle revenue miles, vehicle revenue hours, and some other metrics.\r\nPersonally, I will be much more cautious with current-year data and either not report on it all or at least add more cautionary language about data quality.\r\nIt’d be great if our local transit agency made their raw data reported to FTA available on the City’s own open data portal.\r\nI welcome feedback from others who know more about the NTD reporting and adjustment process.\r\n\r\nThere is a lag of about three months in publishing the data in the website.\r\nFor example right now (April 6, 2023), the most recent data available is for January 2023.↩︎\r\n",

    "contents": "\r\nThe City of Madison’s open data portal has a tax parcel dataset. Tax information, however, is not the only thing included in the dataset. There are over 140 variables and for this post we will look at three of them: The year the structure on the parcel was built, the use of the property, and the architectural style.\r\n\r\nCorrection 2023-02-21: The originally published version of this post used the BuiltYear variable for the map of the age of buildings. Jim Kreft pointed out that there is another variable in the dataset, Maxconstru, which has more complete data. The code and map have been updated accordingly.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\nlibrary(sf)\r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\r\n\r\n\r\nbuildings <- read_sf(\"/Users/user1/Downloads/Tax_Parcels_(Assessor_Property_Information)/Tax_Parcels_(Assessor_Property_Information).shp\")\r\nbuildings <- buildings |> \r\n  st_make_valid()\r\n\r\n\r\nBuilding age\r\nLet’s start with the YearBuilt variable. This allows us a glimpse into the development of Madison over time. First, a static map:\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\nbuildings2 <- buildings |> \r\n  mutate(MaxConstru = na_if(MaxConstru, 0),\r\n         MaxConstru_labels = cut(MaxConstru,\r\n                                breaks = c(-Inf, 1900, 1945, 1980, 2000, 2010, Inf),\r\n                                labels = c(\"pre-1900\", \"1900 to 1944\", \"post-WWII to 1979\", \"1980 to 1999\", \"2000 to 2009\", \"2010 and newer\"),\r\n                                ordered_result = T))\r\n\r\nlibrary(tmap)\r\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\r\ntmap_options(bg.color = \"black\", legend.text.color = \"white\")\r\np <- buildings2 |> \r\n  select(MaxConstru_labels) |> \r\n  tm_shape() +\r\n  tm_polygons(title = \"\", \"MaxConstru_labels\", border.alpha = 0, style = \"cont\",\r\n              colorNA = \"darkgrey\") +\r\n  tm_credits(\"Map: @HaraldKliems.

We also see that a lot of parcels have missing data, and that missingness doesn’t seem to be random. It’d be interesting to know why the city has better data on some properties/areas/eras than on others!\r\nProperty use\r\nThe age of a structure only tells us part of a story. How is a building use, and how do these uses cluster? The property use data has many different categories, and to keep the map legible we need to lump a lot of them together. This is what we get for the 10 most common uses:\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\np2 <- buildings2 |>\r\n  select(PropertyUs) |>\r\n  mutate(PropertyUs = case_when(\r\n    str_detect(PropertyUs, \"Apartment$\") ~ \"Apartment\",\r\n    str_detect(PropertyUs, \"^Condominium\") ~ \"Condominium\",\r\n    TRUE ~ PropertyUs\r\n  )) |>\r\n  mutate(PropertyUs_collapsed = fct_lump_n(PropertyUs, 10)) |>\r\n  tm_shape() +\r\n  tm_polygons(\r\n    title = \"\",\r\n    \"PropertyUs_collapsed\",\r\n    border.alpha = 0,\r\n    colorNA = \"ghostwhite\"\r\n  ) +\r\n  tm_credits(\"Map: @HaraldKliems.

Data: City of Madison Tax Parcels\") +\r\n  tm_layout(\r\n    title = \"Architectural style of Madison buildings\",\r\n    scale = .6,\r\n    bg.color = \"black\",\r\n    legend.text.color = \"white\",\r\n    title.color = \"white\",\r\n    legend.title.color = \"white\"\r\n  )\r\n\r\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\r\np3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLumping together the less common styles under “Other” is a little unfortunate for this variable. It’ll make use miss out on less common but interesting architectural styles such as “Spanish mediterranean” or “New style modern international”. So let’s at least have a table with all the styles and how common they are.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\nbuildings2 |> st_drop_geometry() |>\r\n  select(HomeStyle) |>\r\n  mutate(HomeStyle = case_when(str_detect(HomeStyle, \"^Ranch\") ~ \"Ranch\",\r\n                               str_detect(HomeStyle, \"^Townhouse\") ~ \"Townhouse\",\r\n                               str_detect(HomeStyle, \"^Garden\") ~ \"Garden\",\r\n                               TRUE ~ HomeStyle)) |>\r\n           group_by(HomeStyle) |>\r\n           tally(sort = T) |>\r\n  DT::datatable()\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "contents": "\r\n\r\nThe non-profit I am involved with, Madison Bikes, has been doing candidate questionnaires for local elections for several election cycles now.\r\nWith each iteration, we learn some things about the best process to make this happen.\r\nHow do you keep track of candidates?\r\nHow do you best collect responses?\r\nAnd then how do you present those responses to your community?\r\nFor the 2023 spring primary and general elections, we used a new process that takes some of those lessons learned and saved us a lot of work. In this post, I will describe the process with the goal of documenting for ourselves and also allowing others to adapt it to their own purposes. The first sections are about the logistics and of interest to anyone who wants to do candidate questionnaires. The second part gets into the technical process of using R programming to take the responses and format them.\r\nIf you want to see what the end result looks like before reading the post, here’s the link.\r\nIdentifying candidates and their contact information\r\nThe first step to a candidate questionnaire is to keep track of who is running.\r\nThe timeline for filing for candidacy is short:\r\nSource: City of Madison Clerk’s Office\r\nDecember 1, 2022\r\nFirst day nomination papers may be circulated.\r\nDecember 23, 2022\r\nDeadline for incumbents not seeking re-election to file Notice of Non-Candidacy.\r\nJanuary 3, 2023\r\nAll papers and forms due in City Clerk’s Office at 5 p.m.\r\nJanuary 6, 2023\r\nDeadline to challenge nomination papers.\r\nI set up a Google Sheet early on and manually kept it up to date as I saw new candidates announcing (or incumbents announcing their non-candidacy), mostly relying on the Clerk’s Office’s candidate filings but also media coverage.\r\nAs we got closer to the deadline, I also started collecting candidates’ websites, social media links, and email addresses.\r\nThis involved a lot of internet searching and was very time consuming.\r\nI later found out that candidates provide an email address to the Clerk’s Office on their official paperwork.\r\nWhen we do this again for the next election cycle, I would no longer manually search and just wait until after the deadline.\r\nDeveloping questions\r\nIn previous years Madison Bikes did their own questionnaire.\r\nWhen we learned that Madison is for People, a housing advocacy organization, was also interested in doing a questionnaire, we connected with them to coordinate efforts.\r\nWe also got Madison Area Bus Advocates on board and developed a joint questionnaire.\r\nPartnering with other organization has the advantage of being able to share some of the logistical work, but it also creates additional coordination work.\r\nOverall, this went very smoothly.\r\nWe needed to make sure that the questionnaire didn’t become too burdensome for the candidates, while still providing meaningful content for our organizations’ respective audiences.\r\nIn the end, each organization provided three to four questions, plus three short joint questions about how candidates get around the city.\r\nWe had slightly different questions for mayoral candidates and candidate for the common council.\r\nDistributing the questions, collecting answers\r\nWe split up the work of emailing candidates between three people (Thanks, Connor, Will, and Jonathan!).\r\nEmails were sent individually, and I think this is something that in the future we could consider automating, e.g. by using Mailchimp or Qualtrics.1\r\nWe tracked the send-out in the same Google Sheet where we kept the contact information.\r\nWe discussed several options for receiving candidate responses.\r\nShould they just sent their responses in an email?\r\nPut them into a Google Doc?\r\nBased on our prior experience we decided to go with a Google Form.\r\nWith over 40 candidates total, anything else would likely have turned into a nightmare.\r\nThe Google Form had a text field for the candidate’s name, a dropdown menu for their district (don’t use a text field for this!), and text fields for each candidate question.\r\nWe carefully tested the survey, for example making sure that the respondents didn’t need a Google account.\r\nThen a link to the survey was included in the emails.\r\nTurning a form into HTML\r\nThe deadline for candidates to respond was only a week before the primary election date.\r\nTurning the form responses into nicely formatted content for our website quickly was therefore very important.\r\nI ended up using RMarkdown and knitr as the main tools for this, relying heavily on the wonderful “R Markdown: The Definitive Guide” and the “R Markdown Cookbook”.\r\nIt’s very much possible that there are better/different tools for this out there, but RMarkdown is what I was familiar with and the final product turned out well.\r\nYou can find the repository with all code on Github: https://github.com/vgXhc/sheets-2-wp\r\nThe Madison Bikes website runs on WordPress, which limited our options of what we could do.\r\nIn the last round of candidate questionnaires, Ben had created a script to create html tags around the responses read in from a csv file.\r\nWe then copied that html into a WordPress custom html block.\r\nThis seemed to work well enough and so I also aimed to create an html document to paste into WordPress, but instead of bare html it would be an html document generated by knitr.\r\nLet’s walk through this step by step.\r\nThere are three main files:\r\ncombined-report.Rmd: This is the file that eventually gets knitted and produces the html and pdf output\r\noutput-council-child.Rmd: The template for generating content blocks within combined-report.Rmd for council candidates.\r\noutout-mayor-child.Rmd: Same, but for mayoral candidates\r\ncombined-report.Rmd has a full yaml header, both for html and pdf output.2\r\n---\r\ntitle: \"Candidate Q&A\"\r\noutput: \r\n  pdf_document:\r\n    toc: TRUE\r\n    toc_depth: 1\r\n  html_document:\r\n    toc: TRUE\r\n    toc_depth: 1\r\n    toc_float: true\r\ndocumentclass: scrreport\r\n---\r\nOne thing we didn’t have last time was a table of contents (TOC), which made it difficult to navigate through the Q&A.\r\nThe toc: true option easily generates the TOC.\r\nA floating TOC would have been even better (it really helps to keep track of where in the document you are) , but since that relies on Bootstrap and jQuery, it doesn’t work in a WordPress html block.\r\nSince Madison is for People and Madison Area Bus Advocates use different content management systems, I rendered a version with and without the floating TOC.\r\nFor the pdf version, I specified the LaTeX document class scrreport from the KOMA-Script bundle.\r\nAfter the yaml header there is a bunch of code to prep the data.\r\nThe form responses are read in with the googlesheets4 package.\r\nThey come in as wide data, with one row for each candidate and one column for each question.\r\nThe code then transforms the data into a long format, with one row for each question and answer.\r\nTo help with formatting, the question is split into a “topic” (everything before the colon) and the actual question.3\r\nThere’s some duplication in the code that could be cleaned up with a function.\r\n\r\n\r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\r\nlibrary(googlesheets4)\r\nlibrary(here)\r\nlibrary(knitr)\r\nresponses_council <-\r\n  read_sheet(\r\n

This was on a very long two-day ride to Illinois I did in October!\r\nNext we add lines for the actual rides to these destinations.

Let’s create a nice static map. For that we need a base map. The Stamen Watercolor is always a nice option. Note the +c(...) after the bounding box command: This enlarges the bounding box in each direction so that our destinations aren’t at the very edge of the map and to make the map a little more square.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\nbasemap <- read_osm(bb(destinations)+c(-.3, -.1, .3, .1), \r\n                    zoom = 10, \r\n                    type = \"stamen-watercolor\")\r\n\r\n\r\nRather than using color to distinguish between the category of destination, we can use custom icons with the tmap_icons() function.

Last year’s ACSmas was cancelled because of the pandemic, but this September we finally got our fix of data for 2021.\r\nACSmas is cancelled this year, everything sucks https://t.co/rGsjpg0WE7— dadbode miller (@bikepedantic) July 29, 2021 I was especially excited about the commuting data: What did the pandemic do to people’s trips to work? How much of a shift to working from home would we see? And was the data quality actually going to be good enough to draw any firm conclusions? What follows is an in-depth look at the ACS commuting data for the City of Madison.\r\nMode share over time\r\nACS mode share data is available all the way back to 2010. In previous posts on the Madison Bikes blog I had already looked at these time series data – and frankly, it was not that exciting: By and large the percentages of different modes of getting to worked stayed the same. Biking didn’t grow but neither shrunk. It seemed highly likely that the pandemic would have changed things up.

What do these percentages look like when we only account for the people who still leave the house to get to work?” Or to put it differently: Before the pandemic, you and 99 of your coworkers went to the office every day, and 10 of you biked. In 2021, half of your coworkers now work from home. Of the remaining 50 people in the office, do you still have 5 (i.e. 10%) people who bike to work?\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\nget_msn_mode_counts <- function(year) {\r\n  acs_data <- get_acs(year = year, survey = \"acs1\", table = \"C08006\", geography = \"place\", state = 55, cache_table=T, summary_var = \"C08006_001\")\r\n  acs_data |> \r\n    filter(NAME == \"Madison city, Wisconsin\") |> \r\n    mutate(year = year)\r\n}\r\n\r\nmsn_counts <- map_dfr(c(2019, 2021), get_msn_mode_counts)\r\n\r\nmsn_counts <- msn_counts |> \r\n  mutate(summary_est = case_when(year == 2019 ~summary_est - 9050,\r\n                                 year == 2021 ~ summary_est - 40279),\r\n         mode_readable = case_when(\r\n    variable == \"C08006_001\" ~ \"Total\",\r\n      variable == \"C08006_002\" ~ \"Drive\",\r\n      variable == \"C08006_003\" ~ \"Drove alone\",\r\n      variable == \"C08006_004\" ~ \"Carpooled\",\r\n      variable == \"C08006_008\" ~ \"Transit\",\r\n      variable == \"C08006_009\" ~ \"Bike\",\r\n      variable == \"C08006_010\" ~ \"Walk\",\r\n      variable == \"C08006_011\" ~ \"Other\",\r\n      variable == \"C08006_012\" ~ \"Work from home\"\r\n  ),\r\n  mode_share = estimate/summary_est) |> \r\n  filter(!is.na(mode_readable)) |> \r\n  filter(mode_readable %in% c(\"Drive\", \"Transit\", \"Bike\", \"Walk\", \"Other\")) |> \r\n  mutate(mode_readable = fct_relevel(mode_readable, \r\n                                     \"Other\",\r\n                                                \"Bike\", \r\n                                                \"Walk\", \r\n                                                \"Transit\", \r\n                                                \"Drive\")) |> \r\n  group_by(year,mode_readable) %>% \r\n    mutate(pos = cumsum(mode_share) - mode_share/2)\r\nmsn_counts |> \r\n  ggplot(aes(as.factor(year), mode_share, fill = mode_readable)) +\r\n  geom_col(position = \"stack\") +\r\n  geom_text(aes(label = mode_readable), position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5), color = \"white\",\r\n            size = 3) +\r\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::label_percent()) +\r\n    hrbrthemes::scale_fill_ipsum(name = \"element_blank()\") +\r\n  hrbrthemes::theme_ipsum() +\r\n  ylab(\"Commute mode share estimate\") +\r\n  xlab(element_blank()) +\r\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\",   panel.grid.major.x = element_blank()) +\r\n  labs(title = \"Transit commutes were the big loser\",\r\n       subtitle =\"City of Madison, working from home excluded\",\r\n       caption = \"American Community Survey 1-year estimates, Table B08006\\nVisualization: Harald Kliems\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the same data in table form.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\nmsn_counts |> \r\n  \r\n  pivot_wider(id_cols = mode_readable, names_from = year, values_from = mode_share, names_prefix = \"mode_share_\") |> \r\n  mutate(change = mode_share_2021- mode_share_2019) |> \r\n  select(mode_readable, mode_share_2019, mode_share_2021, change) |>\r\n  ungroup() |> \r\n  gt() |> \r\n  tab_header(title = \"Change in commute mode for workers not working from home\") |> \r\n  fmt_percent(columns = c(mode_share_2021, mode_share_2019, change), decimals = 0) |> \r\n  tab_spanner(\r\n    label = \"Mode share\",\r\n    columns = c(mode_share_2019, mode_share_2021)\r\n  ) |> \r\n  cols_label(mode_readable = \"Commute mode\", \r\n             mode_share_2021 = \"2021\",\r\n             mode_share_2019 = \"2019\",\r\n             change = \"Change (percentage points)\") |> \r\n   data_color(\r\n    columns = c(change),\r\n    colors = scales::col_numeric(\r\n      palette = \"viridis\",\r\n    domain = NULL )) |> \r\n   tab_source_note(\r\n    source_note = \"Data: American Community Survey 1-year estimates, Table B08006.

Margins of error not shown.\r\n    \r\n\r\nCalculating the margins of error for these estimates is complex and I have not done that. But similar to the error bars we have seen above, changes of less than 2% points are probably not meaningful. So what do we take away from the table and chart? Of the people who still commute to the office, taking the bus is much less common while driving has gone up. The other percentages are basically unchanged. This makes sense: Bus service was reduced and many people perceived riding the bus as a risk for infection. Conversely, peak hour congestion for drivers went down (remember: overall the number of people commuting by car went down even when their percentage here went up) and some employers reduced or waived parking fees.\r\nMode share by gender\r\nDid commuting trends in Madison differ by gender?\r\nEspecially for biking, research has shown that in the US women are underrepresented in bike commuting, take fewer trips on bike share bikes, and generally have different travel patterns compared to men. (Hosford and Winters 2019; Ravensbergen, Fournier, and El-Geneidy 2022) In the 2021 data for Madison, we do not see these differences.\r\nLooking only at the estimates, it may appear that for bike commuting there is indeed a gender difference: 3.6% of men rode their bike to work whereas only 2% of women did so. But when we look at the error bars around the estimates, we see that for all modes they overlap between the two genders and therefore the differences we see in the data may well be by chance.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# faceted plot by gender\r\nmsn_mode_share |> \r\n  filter(!is.na(mode_readable)) |> \r\n  group_by(mode_readable, year, gender) |> \r\n  ggplot(aes(year, estimate, color = mode_readable)) +\r\n  geom_line(size = 1.5) +\r\n  hrbrthemes::scale_color_ipsum(name = \"element_blank()\") +\r\n  geom_pointrange(aes(ymin = estimate - moe, ymax = estimate + moe), size = 1.3, fatten = 1.5, alpha = .7) +\r\n  hrbrthemes::theme_ipsum() +\r\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(2010, 2012, 2014, 2016,  2019, 2021), minor_breaks = NULL, limits = c(2010, 2023)) +\r\n  ylab(\"estimate (%)\") +\r\n  labs(title = \"How people get to work in Madison does not differ by gender\",\r\n       subtitle =\"City of Madison commute mode share, 2010-2021\",\r\n       caption = \"American Community Survey 1-year estimates, Table S0801\\nVisualization: Harald Kliems\") +\r\n  geom_text(data = msn_mode_share_2021, aes(label = paste0(mode_readable, \" \", estimate, \"%\")), nudge_x = 1) +\r\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") +\r\n  facet_wrap(~ fct_relevel(gender, \"total\", \"female\", \"male\"))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\nmsn_mode_share_2021 |> \r\n  filter(gender != \"total\") |> \r\n  ggplot(aes(fct_reorder(mode_readable, estimate), estimate, color = gender)) +\r\n  geom_pointrange(aes(ymin = estimate - moe, ymax = estimate + moe), \r\n                  size = 1.3, \r\n                  fatten = 1.1,\r\n                  #alpha = .7,\r\n                  position = position_dodge(width = 0.3)) +\r\n  coord_flip() +\r\n  hrbrthemes::scale_color_ipsum(name = element_blank(),\r\n                                breaks = c(\"male\", \"female\"),\r\n                                guide = guide_legend(override.aes = list(shape = NA, size = 5))) +\r\n  hrbrthemes::theme_ipsum() +\r\n  theme(panel.grid.major.y = element_blank()) +\r\n  ylab(\"estimate (%)\") +\r\n  xlab(element_blank()) +\r\n  labs(title = \"How people get to work in Madison\\ndoes not differ by gender\",\r\n       subtitle = \"2021 estimates and 90% margin of error\",\r\n       caption = \"American Community Survey 1-year estimates, Table S0801\\nVisualization: Harald Kliems\") +\r\n   annotate(\r\n    geom = \"curve\", x = \"Transit\", y = 15, xend = \"Bike\", yend = 3, \r\n    curvature = -.3, arrow = arrow(length = unit(2, \"mm\"))\r\n  ) +\r\n  annotate(geom = \"text\", y = 15, x = \"Transit\", label = \"Error bars still overlap\", hjust = \"left\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMode share by race and ethnicity\r\nMuch has been written about the racial disparities of the COVID epidemic. Infection rates, the outcomes of an infection, and who was and wasn’t able to work from home often followed the patterns of structural racism. The American Community Survey data does provide a breakdown of commute modes by race. However, the more you break down the data into smaller categories, the larger the margins of error get. We saw above that for the total population of Madison or for the mode share by gender, the margins of error were already sizable. If we now break down the data into race and ethnicity categories, this becomes even more problematic. And because Madison is predominantly White, the error margins are largest for non-White population groups. So when you look at the following graph, note the wide error bars and not just the point estimates.

Black commuters appear to drive to work at a higher proportion than non-Hispanic White ones.\r\nFor working from home we see a split between non-Hispanic White and Asian on the higher end and Black and Hispanic/Latino on the lower end. Much has been written how some jobs that were deemed essential, such as care or service work as well as many manufacturing jobs, are ones that can’t be done remotely and that are often done by Black or Hispanic workers.\r\nThe share of people walking to work doesn’t differ significantly between any of the groups.\r\nCarpooling appears to be especially common among Hispanic/LatinX workers. But note the wide error bar again: The only pairing where the bars do not overlap is between Hispanic/LatinX and non-Hispanic White.\r\nThe next category lumps together cabs, motorcycles, bicycles, and other means of transportation to work. Like with walking, there are no significant differences between the groups.\r\nThe same is true for transit: All the error bars overlap, i.e. no significant differences.\r\nThere’s more than ACS: Bike count analysis webinar\r\nWebinarThe American Community Survey only captures commuting, and trips to work only make up about 20% of all our trips. There are other limitations to the data, e.g. for work trips that involve more than one mode or for people on hybrid work arrangements. Therefore we can only conclude so much from it and should try to include other sources of data about biking in Madison.\r\nOne such source are the numerous bike counters that we have on our paths and roads. If you live in Madison, you are probably familiar with the Eco-Counter displays on the Southwest Path at Camp Randall and on the Cap City Trail at North Shore Drive.\r\nBut there are numerous other counters throughout the city, and we’re in the fortunate position to have help with analyzing the data from these counters: Madison Bikes together with Bike Fitchburg were awarded a data analysis grant from the League of American Bicyclists and Eco-Counter!\r\nWith the help from the city, we shared loads of counter data with them and the data analysis specialists at Eco Counter will analyze it.\r\nI haven’t see the results yet, but on October 26 you can join a free webinar where we will present results from the analysis and show how they are important for bike advocacy.

This is a proprietary Microsoft file format used by Outlook for storing emails. I quickly checked if there was an R package for handling the data, and indeed there is: msgextractor. With this package and some R and RMarkdown I figured converting the files to something more convenient would not be too difficult.\r\nIn the end it took me much longer than I had hoped, but it works. The process has two pieces: An R script with a function to read in a single email, extract some information, and save the email’s attachments in a separate folder. The second piece: A RMarkdown .Rmd template that uses variables generated in the function to create an HTML file with email metadata, the body, and links to the attachments. The R then script then iterates the function over the list of *.msg files with the walk function from the {purr} package. This creates one HTML file for each of the emails.\r\nHere’s the R script:\r\n\r\n\r\nlibrary(msgxtractr) #install with devtools::install_github(\"hrbrmstr/msgxtractr\") \r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\r\nlibrary(here)\r\n\r\n# read list of msg files in folders\r\nfiles <- list.files(\"data/All Files/\")\r\n\r\n# extract and save attachments and return paths\r\nwrite_msg_files <- function(msg_file){\r\n  msg <- read_msg(paste0(\"data/All Files/\", msg_file))\r\n  dir_name <- paste0(\"output/\", msg_file)\r\n  dir.create(dir_name)\r\n  save_attachments(msg_obj = msg, path = dir_name)\r\n  #return path and file names for attachments\r\n  attachment_names <- list.files(dir_name)\r\n  attachment_paths <- paste0(msg_file, \"/\", attachment_names)\r\n  # contents for output documents\r\n  email <- data_frame(email = msg_file,\r\n                   from = unlist(msg$headers$From),\r\n                   to = unlist(msg$headers$To),\r\n                   cc = unlist(msg$headers$CC),\r\n                   subject = unlist(msg$headers$Subject),\r\n                   date = unlist(msg$headers$Date),\r\n                   body = paste(msg$body$text, collapse = \"\\n\"),\r\n                   attachments = list(attachment_paths))\r\n  \r\n  #render output document\r\n  rmarkdown::render(\r\n    input = \"output_template.Rmd\",\r\n    output_file = here(\"output\", paste0(msg_file, \".html\"))\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n# iterate over list of files\r\nwalk(files, write_attachments)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd this is what the output template looks like:\r\n\r\n    ---\r\n    output: html_document\r\n    ---\r\n\r\n    ```{r setup, include=FALSE}\r\n    knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = F)\r\n```\r\n\r\n    ```{r}\r\n    library(msgxtractr)\r\n    library(tidyverse)\r\n    ```\r\n    # `r email[1,]$email`\r\n\r\n    **From:** `r email[1,]$from`\r\n\r\n    **To:** `r email$to`\r\n\r\n    **CC:** `r email$cc`\r\n\r\n    **Date:** `r email$date`\r\n\r\n    **Subject:** `r email$subject`\r\n\r\n    ```{r results='asis'}\r\n    cat(email[1,]$body)\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    ## Attachments\r\n    ```{r results='asis'}\r\n    #creates markdown links to attachments\r\n    map_chr(email$attachments[[1]], ~paste0(\"[\", ., \"](\", ., \")\"))\r\n    ```\r\n\r\nThis works nicely, with one exception: There were two msg files whose content was another msg file as an attachment (which in turn had attachments). msgxtractor currently can’t deal with these and so I had to remove them from the dataset.\r\nHere’s what the output:\r\nScreenshot of html outputMaybe this can be useful for others.

Our population is growing, and the growth of housing stock has not kept pace, leading to higher rents and real estate prices. There have been iniatives to increase the production of housing, but how successful have they been? Inspired by a thread on Twitter, this post looks at building permit data.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\nlibrary(dplyr)\r\nlibrary(readr)\r\nlibrary(tidyr)\r\nlibrary(lubridate)\r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\r\nlibrary(tidycensus)\r\nlibrary(forcats)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPopulation growth\r\nMadison has been and continues to be one of the fasted growing cities in the state of Wisconsin. Between 1970 and 2020, the city added almost 100,000 new residents. That is an increase of about 56 percent.1\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# Population time series Madison city\r\npop <- read_csv(\"data/nhgis0002_ts_nominal_place.csv\")\r\n\r\n\r\npop %>% \r\n  filter(NHGISCODE == \"G55048000\" & YEAR %in% c(\"1970\", \"1980\", \"1990\", \"2000\", \"2010\", \"2020\")) %>% \r\n  # mutate(difference = AV0AA - lag(AV0AA)) %>% \r\n  # relocate(difference)\r\n  ggplot(aes(as.numeric(YEAR), AV0AA)) +\r\n  geom_line(size = 1.5) +\r\n  xlab(\"Year\") +\r\n  ylab(\"Population\")+\r\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma, limits = c(0, 275000)) +\r\n  theme(panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank()) +\r\n  labs(caption = \"Data: US Census, IPUMS NHGIS, University of Minnesota, www.nhgis.org\\nVisualization: Harald Kliems\",\r\n       title = \"Madison's population grew from\\n173,000 in 1970 to 270,000 in 2020 (+56%)\") +\r\n  hrbrthemes::theme_ipsum_rc()\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThese new residents all need housing, and in general household sizes have been shrinking, requiring even more housing units. What does housing production look like in the city and the surrounding metro area?\r\nHousing permits over time\r\nThe Office of Policy Development and Research within the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) keeps track of building permits issues on a monthly basis. Monthly data is choppy: A single large development can easily throw off the total in a month. Thus we look at the data in half year periods:\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\n# housing permits Madison city\r\npermits <- read_csv(\"data/BuildingPermits(1).csv\")\r\n\r\n#housing permits for Madison CBSA\r\nCBSA <- read_csv(\"data/BuildingPermits - Madison CBSA.csv\")\r\n\r\n# combine and prep city and CBSA data\r\npermits_all <- permits %>% \r\n  rbind(CBSA) %>% \r\n    filter(Location == \"Madison, WI\" | Location == \"MADISON\") %>% \r\n    mutate(date = ym(paste(Year, Month)),\r\n         quarter = quarter(date),\r\n         semester = semester(date),\r\n         place = case_when(Location == \"MADISON\" ~ \"City of Madison\",\r\n                              Location == \"Madison, WI\" ~ \"Madison metro area\")) %>% \r\n  filter(date < ymd(\"2022-07-01\"))  #remove 0 values for future months\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\npermits_all %>% \r\n  filter(`Series Code` == 1) %>% #total units\r\n  group_by(Year, semester, place) %>% \r\n  summarise(permits = sum(Permits), date) %>% \r\n  distinct(Year, semester, permits, place, .keep_all = T) %>% \r\n  pivot_wider(names_from = place, values_from = permits) %>% \r\n  mutate(metro_without_city = `Madison metro area` - `City of Madison`) %>% \r\n  pivot_longer(cols = c(metro_without_city, `City of Madison`, `Madison metro area`), names_to = \"place\", values_to = \"permits\") %>% \r\n  filter(place %in% c(\"metro_without_city\", \"City of Madison\")) %>% \r\n  ggplot(aes(date, permits, color = fct_reorder(place, permits))) +\r\n  geom_line(size = 1.5) +\r\n  ylim(0,2000)+\r\n  hrbrthemes::scale_color_ipsum(name = NULL, labels = c(\"Madison metro area,\\nwithout City\", \"City of Madison only\")) +\r\n  hrbrthemes::theme_ipsum_rc() +\r\n  theme(legend.position = \"right\") +\r\n  labs(title = \"New housing units permitted in the City of\\n Madison and the surrounding metro area\", subtitle = \"Both the total number and the trend over\\ntime are similar between the two\",\r\n       caption = \"Data: https://socds.huduser.gov/permits/\\nVisualization: Harald Kliems\\nMadison metro area encompasses Dane, Green, Iowa, and Columbia counties\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHousing production in the City of Madison was strong during the early aughts. And in the surrounding metro area it was even stronger. But once the financial crisis hit, it took almost a decade until housing construction returned to previous levels. We can also see the shock the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, and how that permitting backlog cleared over the course of 2020.\r\nHow do the 946 units permitted in Madison in the first half of 2022 compare to other cities? Not too badly:\r\n\r\nSome other housing start totals at the half-year mark:Seattle: 5,542 unitsDenver: 4,707 unitsBoston: 2,610 unitsWashington: 2,471 unitsPhiladelphia: 1,265 unitsPortland: 873 unitsSan Jose: 854 unitsOakland: 755 unitsSan Francisco: 660 units (lol, lmao) https://t.co/137zelFEsN— Alex Schieferdecker (@alexschief) August 2, 2022 We permitted more units than Portland (pop 652k), Oakland (441k), San Jose (1,013k), and San Francisco (874k)!\r\nTypes of housing\r\nThe previous section describes the growth in total units of housing.

As someone who is passionate about transit and as a member of the Transportation Commission, I have been following the project closely. When I saw a number of isochrone maps showing how far you can get by transit within 45 minutes, I was curious: How do those isochrones compare to ones by bike from the same location? I decided to build a Shiny app. This post provides some technical detail. To go straight to the map, click here\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1: Screenshot of the app\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExtracting the maps\r\nMetro published the maps as appendices in pdf format, with one map per page. With a large number of maps, extracting them manually and renaming each one seemed like a lot of work. Instead I let R handle the process.\r\nExtracting the pages from the pdf as images is easy with the magick package. But how do you name the images in a way that reflects their location? So, for example, “Raymond at McKenna.png”? Well, all the maps have the name of the location in the same place on the page. And so can again use magick to crop the page to just that area and then use optical character recognition to extract the text.\r\nThe cropping required some of trial and error to get the area right. For example, I initially cropped the bottom of the area too close, leading to characters like “p” or “q” being mis-recognized as “o”. But once the area was correct, the OCR worked almost flawlessly.\r\nHere is the full function:\r\n\r\n\r\nread_page <- function(page, pdf_name){\r\n  p <- image_read_pdf(pdf_name, pages = page, density = 600)\r\n   location <- p %>% image_crop(geometry = \"2400x200+60+385\") %>% \r\n   image_ocr()\r\n   path_name = paste0(str_sub(location, end = -2), \".png\")\r\n   image_write(p, path = path_name)\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll that remains is then to iterate the function over the pages of the pdf files with map:\r\n\r\n\r\nmap(1:pdf_info(\"data/AdditionalIsochrones.pdf\")$pages, ~ read_page(page = ., pdf_name = \"data/AdditionalIsochrones.pdf\"))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIsochrones with openrouteservice\r\nBefore we can generate isochrones, we need a shapefile of the start locations. I maybe could have used the names extracted in the previous step and run them through a geocoder to automate the process. Instead I put the locations on a map manually in QGIS and exported the locations as a geojson.\r\nNext, we need a function that takes three inputs (location [sf_point object], type of vehicle, time range) and return a location (sf_polygon).\r\n\r\n\r\ncreate_iso <- function(location, profile_1, range_1){\r\n  iso <- ors_isochrones(locations = st_coordinates(location), \r\n                                 profile = ors_profile(mode = profile_1),\r\n                                 range = range_1,\r\n                       output = \"sf\")\r\n  iso$geometry\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe OpenRouteService API has a limit of 5 locations per call, and so we create the isochrones one after the other with a mutate call. For this we need to set up the data frame of locations so that it has one row for each location, each vehicle type, and each time range.1\r\n\r\n\r\norigins <- st_read(\"data/network_redesign_travel_time_map_locations.geojson\")\r\n\r\n\r\nReading layer `network_redesign_travel_time_map_locations' from data source `C:\\Users\\user1\\Documents\\network_redesign_isochrones\\data\\network_redesign_travel_time_map_locations.geojson' \r\n  using driver `GeoJSON'\r\nSimple feature collection with 41 features and 2 fields\r\nGeometry type: POINT\r\nDimension:     XY\r\nBounding box:  xmin: -89.52713 ymin: 43.01574 xmax: -89.26672 ymax: 43.14486\r\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\r\n\r\norigins_2 <- origins %>% \r\n  mutate(mode_ebike = \"e-bike\", \r\n         mode_bike = \"bike\", \r\n         time_15 = 900, \r\n         time_30 = 1800, \r\n         time_45 = 2700) %>% \r\n  pivot_longer(starts_with(\"mode\"),\r\n               names_to = \"mode_var\",\r\n               values_to = \"bike_type\") %>% pivot_longer(starts_with(\"time_\"),\r\n                                                         names_to = \"time_var\", \r\n                                                         values_to = \"time\") %>% \r\n  select(-c(mode_var, time_var, id))\r\n\r\nhead(origins_2) %>% \r\n  kableExtra::kable()\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nname\r\n\r\n\r\ngeometry\r\n\r\n\r\nbike_type\r\n\r\n\r\ntime\r\n\r\n\r\nAnderson at Wright\r\n\r\n\r\nPOINT (-89.33044 43.12018)\r\n\r\n\r\ne-bike\r\n\r\n\r\n900\r\n\r\n\r\nAnderson at Wright\r\n\r\n\r\nPOINT (-89.33044 43.12018)\r\n\r\n\r\ne-bike\r\n\r\n\r\n1800\r\n\r\n\r\nAnderson at Wright\r\n\r\n\r\nPOINT (-89.33044 43.12018)\r\n\r\n\r\ne-bike\r\n\r\n\r\n2700\r\n\r\n\r\nAnderson at Wright\r\n\r\n\r\nPOINT (-89.33044 43.12018)\r\n\r\n\r\nbike\r\n\r\n\r\n900\r\n\r\n\r\nAnderson at Wright\r\n\r\n\r\nPOINT (-89.33044 43.12018)\r\n\r\n\r\nbike\r\n\r\n\r\n1800\r\n\r\n\r\nAnderson at Wright\r\n\r\n\r\nPOINT (-89.33044 43.12018)\r\n\r\n\r\nbike\r\n\r\n\r\n2700\r\n\r\n\r\nNow we just run a mutate call with the rowwise function of dplyr and create isochrones for each row 2 :\r\n\r\n\r\nbike_isochrones <- origins_2 %>% \r\n  rowwise() %>% \r\n  mutate(iso = create_iso(geometry, bike_type, time))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe save the dataframe as an RDS file that we can then use in the app.\r\nThe app\r\nNow we have all the pieces in place for the Shiny app. To get a layout with the maps side-by-side I used the fluidpage way of designing the UI, which was pretty easy.\r\nThe exception was the scaling of the bus map image. In the UI, the map is added with imageOutput, which takes a width and height parameter; on the server side, the image is generate with a renderImage call, which also takes dimension parameters. In theory, the Shiny UI should resize things dynamically based on the screen size, but in practice this was difficult to get right. Through trial-and-error I figured out a scaling that works on most screen sizes, but in some cases the image will still overlap other elements of the app.\r\nOther than that, the code is pretty straightforward. You can see the latest version here.\r\n\r\nAnother way to do this would have been to use pmap, iterating over the three parameters each.↩︎\r\nShoutout to the UW-Madison Data Science Hub team and Martin Gal on StackOverflow to help me figure out the rowwise step.↩︎\r\n",

    "contents": "\r\nA very quick chart: There are large differences between how transit agencies (in the US and in Europe) have managed to recover their pre-COVID ridership. Madison Metro’s general manager has always been very open about the fact that recovery would take several years: Metro is facing staffing shortages, which prevents them from expanding service. Funding right now is not a problem, but once pandemic recovery funds run out it will be. Finally, UW-Madison as well local and state government agency have been large drivers of ridership – it remains to be seen if a loss of peak commutes can be substituted with other transit trips.\r\nBut first we have to ask: What do the ridership numbers look like? The National Transit Database provides monthly ridership time series data all the way back to 2002. Here is a time series plot of that data:\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\nlibrary(readxl)\r\nbus <- read_excel(\"data/January 2022 Ajusted Database.xlsx\", sheet = 3)\r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\r\nlibrary(lubridate)\r\nbus_long <- bus %>% \r\n  pivot_longer(cols = 10:250, names_to = \"month\", values_to = \"value\") %>% \r\n  mutate(date = my(month)) %>% \r\n  filter(Agency == \"City of Madison\" & Modes == \"MB\")\r\n\r\nbus_long %>%\r\n  ggplot(aes(date, value/1000)) +\r\n  geom_line() +\r\n  labs(title = \"Monthly unlinked passenger trips for Madison Metro\",\r\n       subtitle = \"In January 2022, ridership still was only 23% of that in January 2020\",\r\n       caption = \"Data: National Transit Database Monthly Module Adjusted Data Release\\nVisualization: Harald Kliems\") +\r\n  ylab(\"Trips (1000s)\") +\r\n   scale_x_date(\r\n    NULL,\r\n    breaks = scales::breaks_width(\"2 years\"), \r\n    labels = scales::label_date(\"'%y\")\r\n  ) +\r\n  scale_y_continuous(\r\n     labels = scales::label_comma(),\r\n     limits = c(0, 1600)) +\r\n  geom_line(data = bus_long %>% filter(date == \"2020-01-01\" | date == \"2022-01-01\"), color = \"red\", size = 1.5, linetype = 2,\r\n            alpha = 0.4) +\r\n  geom_point(data = bus_long %>% filter(date == \"2020-01-01\" | date == \"2022-01-01\"), color = \"red\", size = 2.5) +\r\n  theme_minimal()\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe can see: While ridership is well above its worst pandemic lows, there still is a long way to go until we get back to pre-pandemic numbers. In January 2022, the latest month available, ridership was less than a quarter than what it was in January 2020.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

In the post, the stop was listed with 30 departures, which is exactly twice as many as it actually has. I have identified what caused the issue and updated the post accordingly. If you notice any other errors, please let me know.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\nlibrary(tidytransit)\r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\r\nlibrary(lubridate)\r\nlibrary(kableExtra)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSomeone opened a Github issue on my blog post about creating a map of bus boardings:\r\n\r\nI know its kind of old but I was (re)visiting it in looking at the newest version of the redesign plan. It is difficult to compare ridership across stops when I know that some stops have more buses serving them than others. It would be cool to have ridership per bus or a similar measure. But I guess what we’d want is pre-pandemic frequencies. Is there even a source for old schedules were we to want to do it by hand?\r\n\r\nI responded:\r\n\r\nTo get the number of buses at each stop, you’d need 1) a pre-pandemic GTFS schedule file and 2) code to parse that data in the way you want. The former appears to be available via OpenMobilityData. For the latter, I’m not super proficient with GTFS data, but number of buses at a given stop I think is not that hard. \\[...\\] I’ll see if I find some time to play around with the old GTFS file.\r\n\r\nFortunately, there is an R package for working with GTFS data, tidytransit (Poletti et al. 2022), and the package includes helpful vignettes. So I tried answering the question.\r\nParsing pre-pandemic frequencies\r\nThe ridership data provided in my previous post uses a two-week sample from February 2020, right before the COVID-19 pandemic led to massive service reductions and ridership decline. To match the boarding with bus frequencies at that time, we download a GTFS feed from January 30, 2020 from the OpenMobilityData portal.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\ngtfs <- read_gtfs(\"data/gtfs_metro_madison_2020-01-30.zip\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe start with a quick plot of the different service patterns in the first two months on 2020:\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\nlibrary(lubridate)\r\njan_feb_2020 <- interval(\"2020-01-01\", \"2020-02-28\")\r\n\r\ngtfs$.$dates_services %>% \r\n  filter(date %within% jan_feb_2020) %>% \r\n  ggplot() + \r\n  theme_bw() + \r\n  geom_point(aes(x = date, y = service_id, color = wday(date, label = T)), size = 2)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe see that there are some services that run on some or all weekdays, some Saturday and Sunday and holiday services. We can also see that some services only run when the UW is in session/on break. Compared to the service pattern examples from the tidytransit vignettes, this is quite straightforward.\r\nThere is one exception to this straightforwardness: I realized that the final stop on a route gets counted as an additional departure.

But the stop serving the Epic campus in Verona, with only 15 daily departures is really high up there as well. There are only a few other non-UW stops in the list: One serves the Madison College campus on the north side, and one is a Park & Ride lot; and two of the four transfer points made the cut.\r\nHow to interpret these numbers?\r\nWhat does it tell us that a high number of people board a bus at a given stop? Does it help make decisions for projects such as the ongoing Network Redesign? I’m curious what the person who initially asked the question thinks about this.\r\nI can see two possible insights from the metric: A large number of people boarding at a stop leads to longer dwell times. (Fricker 2011) It takes time for people to step on board, pay or validate their fare, and move through the vehicle, and so the bus will be stopped for a longer time. For schedule planning purposes it is therefore useful to have these numbers. Additionally, it may encourage an agency to think about improvements to vehicles serving such a stop or improving the stop itself: Buses with more doors, faster fare payment and validation, wider aisles, stops with level boarding. And finally, a high number of boardings per bus could indicate that a stop is underserved and needs more frequent buses!\r\nAn additional benefit of the metric is that it removes the prominence of the transfer points in the raw numbers. The four transfer points do not have much transit demand by themselves. This is aerial imagery of the North Transfer Point:\r\nAerial imagery of North Transfer Point. The area around the transfer point has parking lots, low-density residential housing, and the now-closed Oscar Meyer plant. Image: Google Maps.The reason for the high raw number of boardings is merely that the current route system is set up in a way that forces riders from outlying areas to transfer at the transfer points to get downtown or across town. That said, even after adjusting for the number of departures, the tranfers points still have a comparatively high number of boardings per bus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFricker, Jon D. 2011. “Transportation Research Board 90th Annual MeetingTransportation Research Board.” In.

And of course I myself run the content end of the Cyclists_of_MSN bot. I had ideas for other Twitter bots but lacked the technical skills to make them happen. So when I recently saw an article documenting how to create a Twitter bot by combining an R script with GitHub Actions, I was intrigued and got coding. The goal: A Twitter account automatically posting content related to Vision Zero in Madison, a policy and action plan that strives to eliminate all traffic fatalities and injuries in our city by 2030.\r\n\r\nI want to document that process here, focusing on things not described in other tutorials and helping others to set up their own Vision Zero bots. In general, I recommend following Matt Dray’s guide. Note his most recent update about needing to apply for elevated access for your Twitter development account!\r\nCrash data\r\nData about traffic crashes in Wisconsin is reported by police and collected and processed by the UW-Madison Traffic Operations and Safety Lab. A user-friendly interactive way to access the data is through the Community Maps portal. The web interface has no obvious option to download the underlying data, but I recently realized that there is indeed an API available, documented here1. First, we download a json file with the crash data for the whole county:\r\n\r\n\r\ndownload.file(\"https://CommunityMaps.wi.gov/crash/public/crashesKML.do?filetype=json&startyear=2022&injsvr=K&injsvr=A&county=dane\", \"crashes.json\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe parameters for the query are mostly obvious: startyear, filetype, and county. Less obvious is the injsvr parameters: The severity of crashes is classified into five classes:\r\nK: Fatality\r\nA: Suspected Serious Injury\r\nB: Suspected Minor Injury\r\nO: No apparent Injury\r\nSo our query retrieves: a GeoJSON file of crashes flagged as fatal or resulting in serious injury2 that occurred in Dane County in 2022.\r\nWe then read in the file with the sf package:\r\n\r\n\r\ndf <- st_read(\"crashes.json\")\r\nglimpse(df)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe do a little bit of data cleaning and also drop the geometry data – for now, we’re not using the geocoded crash locations for anything. Now is also a good time to filter the data to crashes that occurred in the City of Madison.\r\n\r\n\r\ncrashes <- df %>%\r\n  mutate(date = mdy(date),\r\n         totfatl = as.numeric(totfatl),\r\n         totinj = as.numeric(totinj)) %>%\r\n  st_drop_geometry() %>% \r\n  filter(muniname == \"MADISON\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEach row in the data represents one crash – keep that in mind when producing summary data: One crash can lead to multiple injuries or fatalities.\r\nOne thing that still needs fixing is the flags variable. This is where each crash is coded for factors like driver impairment, whether speeding was involved, or if the crash involved a pedestrian or cyclists—or a deer. The problem is that the data is not well formatted. I’m not sure if this is a problem with sf reading the JSON file or something wrong with the JSON file itself. To fix this, we re-read the JSON file with the jsonlite package and append the respective columns to our file.\r\n\r\n\r\ncrashesJSON <- fromJSON(\"crashes.json\")\r\ncrashes <- crashes %>%\r\n  add_column(crashesJSON$features$properties)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSetting up dates\r\nOne challenge I encountered was around setting up time intervals. I don’t know how frequently the data in Community Maps are being updated, but from comparing the data with news reports of crashes, it seems like generally data make it into the portal fairly quickly. Based on that and the overall frequency of deadly and serious crashes, I decided to calculate summary statistics weekly for the preceding week. That makes for a good compromise between timeliness and accuracy.\r\nImplementing this took me some thinking and testing with the lubridate package. First, we set a variable for today:\r\n\r\n\r\nd <- today()\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNext, we need to define an interval for last week:\r\n\r\n\r\nlast_week <- interval(start = floor_date(d, unit = \"week\")-8, end = floor_date(d, unit = \"week\")-1)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe way to do that is by using the rounding functions from lubridate. We round down from today’s date to the nearest week. And then we subtract 8 days to get the beginning of the previous week, and 1 day to get the end of the previous week. It’s possible there is a more elegant way to do this, but this works.\r\nFinally, we create a nicely formatted string for the interval:\r\n\r\n\r\nlast_week_formatted <- paste0(format(last_week@start, \"%d/%m\"),\r\n                         \"-\",\r\n                         format(floor_date(d, unit = \"week\")-1, \"%d/%m\"))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo this will produce something like “05/02-12/02”, which we’ll use for the content of the tweet.\r\nNext, we set up a number of summary variables that will be used for composing the tweet: The weekly and annual number of crashes and of fatalities/serious injuries resulting from those crashes. Lubridate’s %within% operator makes for easy temporal filtering.\r\n\r\n\r\ncrashes_wk <- crashes %>%\r\n  filter(date %within% last_week)\r\n\r\n#weekly numbers\r\ntot_crashes_wk <- crashes_wk %>% nrow()\r\ntot_fat_wk <- crashes_wk %>%\r\n  summarise(sum(totfatl)) %>%\r\n  pull()\r\ntot_inj_wk <- crashes_wk %>%\r\n  summarise(sum(totinj)) %>%\r\n  pull()\r\n\r\n# annual numbers\r\ntot_crashes_yr <- crashes %>% nrow()\r\ntot_fat_yr <- crashes %>%\r\n  summarise(sum(totfatl)) %>%\r\n  pull()\r\ntot_inj_yr <- crashes %>%\r\n  summarise(sum(totinj)) %>%\r\n  pull()\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nComposing the tweet\r\nThere are two pieces to the tweet. First we create the text of the tweet, using the variables we just created. Keep in mind Twitter’s character limit when composing the text.\r\n\r\n\r\ntweet_1 <- paste0(\"Last week in Madison (\",\r\n                  last_week_formatted,\r\n                  \"), there were \",\r\n                tot_fat_wk,\r\n                \" traffic fatalities and \",\r\n                tot_inj_wk,\r\n                \" serious injury crashes. Since the beginning of the year, traffic violence has killed \",\r\n                tot_fat_yr,\r\n                \" people and seriously injured \",\r\n                tot_inj_yr,\r\n                \" people in our city. #VisionZero #StopTrafficViolence\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make the tweet more visually interesting, we add an automatically generated image to it. This is easy with the magick package. We start with a public domain png image (cropped to Twitter’s recommended aspect ratio and overlaid with a semi-transparent layer and our account’s Twitter handle in GIMP).\r\nA public domain image of the Wisconsin State Capitol\r\n\r\nbackground <- image_read(\"madison_1200.png\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then we use image_annotate to add the crash stats to it:\r\n\r\n\r\nimage_text <- paste0(\"Vision Zero update \",\r\n                     last_week_formatted,\r\n                     \"\\n Fatalities: \",\r\n                     tot_fat_wk,\r\n                     \"\\n Serious injuries: \",\r\n                     tot_inj_wk,\r\n                     \"\\n Year-to-date fatalities: \",\r\n                     tot_fat_yr,\r\n                     \"\\n Year-to-date serious injuries:\",\r\n                     tot_inj_yr)\r\n\r\ntweet_1_img <- image_annotate(background,\r\n               image_text,\r\n               size = 60,\r\n               font = \"sans\",\r\n               weight = 700, #bold text\r\n               gravity = \"center\",\r\n               color = \"black\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGetting the text to fit the image in the right place and with the right size requires some experimenting with the parameters. Once finalized, we save the image as a file with image_write.\r\n\r\n\r\nimage_write(tweet_1_img,\r\n            path = \"tweet_1_img.png\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow all that remains to be done in R is to post_tweet:\r\n\r\n\r\npost_tweet(status = tweet_1,\r\n           media = \"tweet_1_img.png\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe result should look something like this:\r\nScreenshot of a tweetAutomation with Github Actions\r\nFor setting up the automation of the bot, I again followed the instructions for the London Map Bot. Make sure you load all required packages as part of your yaml file.\r\nA couple things that tripped me up in the process:\r\nStoring the API credentials as Github Secrets. The Settings > Secrets > Actions page in our Github repository has two types of secrets, Environment Secrets and Repository Secrets. You need to set up your credentials as Repository Secrets. The second (more embarrassing) issue I encountered: Matching the names of the secrets between Github, your R script, and the Github Actions yaml file. There’s a lot of copying and pasting, and the error messages from Github Actions aren’t the most helpful. And so it took me way too long to realize that the failure of my bot to run was caused by mismatched variable names. One thing that helped with troubleshooting was the ability to manually trigger the Github Action with the workflow_dispatch option.\r\nOnce everything was working, we change the trigger to a cron job: Once a week, on Wednesdays at 17:33 UTC (i.e. 12:33 PM Central), the script will run an post the tweet.\r\n\r\n\r\non:\r\n  schedule:\r\n    - cron: '33 17 * * Wed'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have some ideas for additional features for the bot, such as a map of crashes or tweets triggered by the number of crashes crossing certain thresholds. But for now the bot is up and running. For anybody wanting to run a bot for their city or county in Wisconsin, the code is very easy to modify. Just head to the bot’s Github repository and fork it!

The plan is central to guiding the city’s efforts to eliminate all fatal and serious traffic crashes by 2030. One main component of the plan is the high injury network. These are locations that in the past have seen a disproportionate number of crashes. As the draft action plan states: “50% of fatal and severe crashes occur on just 4% of city streets.” It intuitively makes sense: If we know that there are locations where a lot of crashes happen, let’s fix those locations and prevent crashes in the future.\r\nHowever, a comment about data from Montreal’s recently released 2020 Vision Zero report (Ville de Montréal 2021) made me curious. The comment pointed out that when you look at the locations of fatal and serious crashes that happened in 2020 and compare them with crash locations between 2015 and 2019, 85% of those crashes occurred at a location with no recent crash history. This raises the question to what extent past crashes should steer our mitigation efforts (and what alternative approaches there may be.) But first we need to know if these numbers also hold true for Madison.\r\nMap of crash locations in Montreal, comparing 2015-19 with 2020 (Image: City of Montreal)Crash data are available from Community Maps. As a first step we can look at the question visually. Here’s a map that compares 2020 and 2015-19 crashes:\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\ndownload.file(\"https://CommunityMaps.wi.gov/crash/public/crashesKML.do?filetype=json&startyear=2015&en\r\ndyear=2021&injsvr=K&injsvr=A&county=dane\", \"test.json\")\r\n\r\ndf <- st_read(\"test.json\")\r\n\r\nmadison_KA <- df %>% \r\n  filter(muniname == \"MADISON\") %>% \r\n  mutate(date = mdy(date),\r\n         totfatl = as.numeric(totfatl))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\ntmap_mode(\"view\")\r\nmadison_KA %>% \r\n  mutate(yr = year(date),\r\n         yr2020 = case_when(yr == \"2020\" ~ \"2020\",\r\n                            yr %in% c(\"2015\", \"2016\", \"2017\", \"2018\", \"2019\") ~ \"2015-19\")) %>% \r\n  filter(!is.na(yr2020)) %>% \r\n  tm_shape() +\r\n  tm_dots(col = \"yr2020\", title = \"\", popup.vars = F, id = \"yr\") +\r\n  tm_layout(title = \"Fatal and serious crashes in Madison\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nClearly there were crashes in 2020 at new locations. Getting to a percentage requires additional steps. First, we create 125 ft buffers1 around all crash locations.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\nmadison_KA_buffered <- madison_KA %>% \r\n  mutate(yr = year(date),\r\n         yr2020 = case_when(yr == \"2020\" ~ \"2020\",\r\n                            yr %in% c(\"2015\", \"2016\", \"2017\", \"2018\", \"2019\") ~ \"2015-19\")) %>% \r\n  filter(!is.na(yr2020)) %>% \r\n  st_transform(8193) %>% \r\n  st_buffer(125)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow we check for overlap between the buffers. If a 2020 crash buffer intersects with any 2015-19 buffer, we would say it occurred “at the same location.” In other words, a 2020 crash can be at most 250 ft away from a 2015-19 crash to be considered to have happened at the same location.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\npoly_1519 <- madison_KA_buffered %>% \r\n  filter(yr2020 == \"2015-19\") %>% \r\n  st_combine() %>% \r\n  st_make_valid()\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nmadison_KA_buffered %>% \r\n  filter(yr2020 == \"2020\") %>% \r\n  mutate(new = case_when(lengths(st_intersects(.,poly_1519)) > 0 ~ \"same location\",\r\n                         lengths(st_intersects(.,poly_1519)) == 0 ~ \"different location\")) %>% \r\n  group_by(new) %>% \r\n  st_drop_geometry() %>% \r\n  summarize(n = n()) %>% \r\n  ggplot(aes(new, n, fill = new)) +\r\n  hrbrthemes::theme_modern_rc() +\r\n  geom_col(show.legend = F) +\r\n  geom_text(aes(label = n), nudge_y = 4, color = \"white\")+\r\n  scale_fill_brewer() +\r\n  xlab(element_blank())+\r\n  ylab(\"number of crashes\") +\r\n  labs(title = str_wrap(\"Crashes in 2020 often occured in locations with no crash history\", 40),\r\n       caption = str_wrap(\"Data: CommunityMaps crash data for fatal (K) and severe (A) injuries, 2015-20. Analysis and visualization: Harald Kliems\", 65))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe result: Out of the 103 deadly and serious crashes that occurred in 2020, 29 (28%) were at a location where there had also been a crash between 2015 and 2019. The remaining 74 crashes (72%) happened at a location with no previous crash history. This is a lower proportion than what was found in Montreal, where 85% of crashes happened at locations without a crash history. It is possible that some or all of the difference between Madison and Montreal is an artifact of the analysis. For example, the Montreal figures mention “intersections” whereas this analysis does not match crashes to intersections. Changing the buffer around crash locations would also change the proportion (a larger buffer would lead to more matched crashes).\r\nMethodological issues aside, what about the conclusion of the Montreal findings? “This observation reinforces the need to act on the entire road system rather than on sites considered ‘accident-prone.’” Pragmatically, few measures act on the entire road system (e.g. a city-wide speed limit reduction) and we need a process for prioritizing scarce resources. Maybe the takeaway should be that past crash history should be only one part of that prioritization process and that we need to be aware of its limitations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVille de Montréal. 2021. “État de La Sécurité Routière 2020.” Montreal. https://portail-m4s.s3.montreal.ca/pdf/etat_de_la_securite_routiere_2020vdem_0.pdf.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe City uses 250 ft buffers around intersections to distinguish between intersection crashes and road segment crashes. Any crash within that buffer is counted as occurring at that intersection.↩︎\r\n",

A local blogger pointed out a resolution to the Madison Common Council that would have established a number of criteria for possible locations for a shelter for men experiencing homeless. The shelter had been debated for many years, and unsurprisingly it was controversial. The criteria specified in the draft resolution were as follows:\r\nThe site should be greater than .5 mile from any schools or daycares;\r\nThe site should not be located in a Census tract identified as a location of concentrated poverty\r\nThe site should include either an existing building or a lot large enough for new construction;\r\nThe site should include space for future expansion;\r\nThe site should be zoned for commercial or mixed use, and not adjacent to single-family homes;\r\nThe site should be within a few blocks of seven-days-a-week bus service, with a preference for close proximity to BRT routes;\r\nThe site location should be within a walking distance of within 3.5 miles from the Beacon on East Washington; and\r\nThe site should be an active real estate listing that is vacant or soon-to-be-vacant.\r\nThat’s a lot of places where the shelter must not be! It’s also a number of criteria that I could easily map with publicly available data. The meeting at which the resolution would be first discussed was on the same day and I only had the morning before work and my lunch break to put something together. Here’s what I submitted, and there was some post-meeting coverage from a local blogger. Because of the time constraint, the product was not the prettiest, and in this post I make some improvements and include the code.\r\nCity limits\r\nWhat I should have done first but didn’t was to start with the Madison city limits. The shelter is a city shelter and therefore must be within the City of Madison. There are multiple enclaves and exclaves, and so starting with the city limits as the most expansive possible search area should be step 1. Then we can use the other criteria to “stamp out” anything that doesn’t fit. City limits are available on the City of Madison Open Data portal.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\ncity_limit <- st_read(\"data/City_Limit.shp\") %>% \r\n  st_transform(6610)\r\n\r\n\r\nReading layer `City_Limit' from data source \r\n  `C:\\Users\\user1\\Documents\\shelter_locations\\data\\City_Limit.shp' \r\n  using driver `ESRI Shapefile'\r\nSimple feature collection with 4 features and 3 fields\r\nGeometry type: POLYGON\r\nDimension:     XY\r\nBounding box:  xmin: -89.57165 ymin: 42.99815 xmax: -89.24663 ymax: 43.17202\r\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\ntm_shape(city_limit) +\r\n  tm_polygons(\"green\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChildcare locations and schools\r\nFirst of all, the idea that children need to be kept away from people experiencing homelessness is wrong. Second, most people don’t realize how many schools and childcare locations there are. For childcare providers, the Wisconsin Department of Health and Human Services provides a dataset of “[p]oint locations and attributes of certified childcare facilities licensed by the state of Wisconsin.” Public school data is available from the National Center for Education Statistics. Conveniently, both datasets are provided as shapefiles. I didn’t look for data sources for private schools.\r\nFirst we read in the child_care data. I noticed that there is a “capacity” attribute in the dataset. To avoid debates of whether the resolution sponsors would consider someone who provides care to only a few children a “childcare facility,” I filtered the data to only those providers with a capacity larger than 9. To create the half-mile buffers around the locations, I need to project the data to a different coordinate reference system (CRS). The crsuggest package helps identify an appropriate CRS. Note that the CRS I chose uses meters as its units, and so 0.5 miles needs to be provided as 805. Finally, I keep only the parts of the buffers that are within city limits.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\nchild_care <- st_read(\"data/Wisconsin_Licensed_and_Certified_Childcare.shp\")\r\n\r\n\r\nReading layer `Wisconsin_Licensed_and_Certified_Childcare' from data source `C:\\Users\\user1\\Documents\\shelter_locations\\data\\Wisconsin_Licensed_and_Certified_Childcare.shp' \r\n  using driver `ESRI Shapefile'\r\nSimple feature collection with 4669 features and 31 fields\r\nGeometry type: POINT\r\nDimension:     XY\r\nBounding box:  xmin: -10372680 ymin: 5197160 xmax: -9694399 ymax: 5946135\r\nProjected CRS: WGS 84 / Pseudo-Mercator\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\nchild_care_buffers <- child_care %>% \r\n  filter(COUNTY == \"Dane\") %>% \r\n  filter(CAPACITY >9) %>% \r\n  st_transform(6610) %>% \r\n  st_buffer(dist = 805) %>% \r\n  st_intersection(city_limit)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the schools, the process was pretty much the same:\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\nschools <- readRDS(\"data/EDGE_GEOCODE_PUBLICSCH_1920.RDS\") #https://nces.ed.gov/opengis/rest/services/K12_School_Locations/EDGE_GEOCODE_PUBLICSCH_1920/MapServer\r\n\r\nschools_buffers <- schools %>% \r\n  st_transform(6610) %>% \r\n  st_buffer(dist = 805) %>% \r\n  st_intersection(city_limit)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow we can “cut out” the schools and childcare buffers from the city limit map:\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\ntm_shape(city_limit) +\r\n  tm_polygons(\"green\") +\r\n  tm_shape(child_care_buffers) +\r\n  tm_polygons(\"red\", alpha = 1, border.alpha = 0) +\r\n  tm_shape(schools_buffers) +\r\n  tm_polygons(\"red\", alpha = 1, border.alpha = 0)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt’s obvious: This criterion alone eliminate huge swaths of the city as possible locations.\r\nZoning districts\r\n\r\nThe site should be zoned for commercial or mixed use, and not adjacent to single-family homes;\r\n\r\nI’ve posted about zoning in Madison previously and so I’m pretty familiar with the data. Zoning data is on the Open Data portal.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\nzoning <- st_read(\"data/Zoning_Districts.shp\")\r\n\r\n\r\nReading layer `Zoning_Districts' from data source \r\n  `C:\\Users\\user1\\Documents\\shelter_locations\\data\\Zoning_Districts.shp' \r\n  using driver `ESRI Shapefile'\r\nSimple feature collection with 2343 features and 9 fields\r\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\r\nDimension:     XY\r\nBounding box:  xmin: -89.57153 ymin: 42.99815 xmax: -89.24663 ymax: 43.17202\r\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\r\n\r\nWhich zoning districts should be included? Ordinance does have a high-level category called “Mixed use and commercial districts,” which includes\r\nLMX Limited Mixed-Use\r\nNMX Neighborhood Mixed-Use District\r\nTSS Traditional Shopping Street District\r\nMXC Mixed-Use Center District\r\nCC-T Commercial Corridor - Transitional District\r\nCC Commercial Center District\r\nRMX Regional Mixed-Use District\r\nArguably, many would also consider some of the zoning districts listed under the “Downtown and Urban Core” heading as mixed use. As it has “mixed use” in its name, I’ll include UMX Urban Mixed-Use.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\nmixed_use <- c(\"NMX\", \"TSS\", \"MXC\", \"CC-T\", \"CC\", \"UMX\", \"RMX\")\r\n\r\nzoning_mixed_use <- zoning %>% \r\n  filter(!(ZONING_COD %in% mixed_use)) %>% \r\n  st_transform(st_crs(city_limit))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI’ll overlay these in red again and change the color of the previously cut out areas to grey.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\ntm_shape(city_limit) +\r\n  tm_polygons(\"green\") +\r\n  tm_shape(zoning_mixed_use) +\r\n  tm_polygons(\"red\", alpha = 1, border.alpha = 0) +\r\n  tm_shape(child_care_buffers) +\r\n  tm_polygons(alpha = 1, border.alpha = 0) +\r\n  tm_shape(schools_buffers) +\r\n  tm_polygons(alpha = 1, border.alpha = 0)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd there goes much of the rest of the city.\r\nClose to the Beacon\r\nI probably could have stopped here, but as it’s an interesting one, I’ll add one more: The 3.5 mile walkshed around the Beacon, an existing homeless services day center on East Washington Ave. For sending my letter, I used the OpenRouteService (ORS) web interface to generate the walkshed. However, it’s also possible to access ORS through an API with the R package openrouteservice-r, which I will do here. First, we geocode the Beacon’s address:\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\nlibrary(openrouteservice)\r\nbeacon <- ors_geocode(\"The Beacon, Madison, Wisconsin, USA\", output = \"sf\", size = 1)\r\n\r\ntm_shape(city_limit) +\r\n  tm_polygons()+\r\n  tm_shape(beacon) +\r\n  tm_dots(\"red\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow we generate the 3.5 mile walking distance. The ors_isochrone functions requires the location to be a long/lat coordinate pair.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\nbeacon_coord <- st_coordinates(beacon)\r\n\r\nbeacon_walkshed <- ors_isochrones(st_coordinates(beacon), \r\n                                  profile = ors_profile(\"walking\"),\r\n                                  units = \"mi\",\r\n                                  range = 3.5,\r\n                                  range_type = \"distance\",\r\n                                  #smoothing = \"15\", \r\n                                  output = \"sf\") %>% \r\n  st_transform(st_crs(city_limit))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQuick visual check:\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\ntm_shape(city_limit) +\r\n  tm_polygons(alpha = .1) +\r\ntm_shape(beacon_walkshed) +\r\n  tm_polygons(\"red\", alpha = .3)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain, we’ll change the previously cut out parts to grey and show everything outside the walk shed in red.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\r\ntm_shape(city_limit) +\r\n  tm_polygons(\"green\") +\r\n  tm_shape(zoning_mixed_use) +\r\n  tm_polygons(\"red\", alpha = 1, border.alpha = 0) +\r\n  tm_shape(child_care_buffers) +\r\n  tm_polygons(alpha = 1, border.alpha = 0) +\r\n  tm_shape(schools_buffers) +\r\n  tm_polygons(alpha = 1, border.alpha = 0) +\r\n  tm_shape(st_difference(city_limit, beacon_walkshed)) +\r\n  tm_polygons(\"red\", border.alpha = 0)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat’s left?\r\nWe could keep going with the remaining criteria, but a) they’re harder to implement and b) it looks like not much green is left in the map above. This is a good moment to change to interactive viewing and see what those green areas are:\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\nwhats_left <- st_intersection(beacon_walkshed, city_limit)\r\n\r\n#helper function to \"erase\" geometry y from x\r\nst_erase <-  function(x, y) st_difference(x, st_union(y))\r\n\r\nwhats_left <- st_erase(whats_left, child_care_buffers)\r\n\r\nwhats_left <- st_erase(whats_left, schools_buffers)\r\n\r\nwhats_left <- st_erase(whats_left, zoning_mixed_use)\r\n\r\ntmap_options(check.and.fix = TRUE)\r\n\r\ntmap_mode(\"view\")\r\ntm_shape(whats_left) +\r\n  tm_polygons(\"green\", alpha = .5)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLeft as possible locations are: The two largest areas are on the water, on Lake Wingra and Monona Bay. Other than some thin slivers of land that are clearly too small (and probably artefacts), there are three remaining spots. Two small triangles in the Eken Park neighborhood near the Oscar Mayer area (one currently a rental car parking lot; the other a single-family home zoned Commercial). And finally a cluster of properties at the intersection of Milwaukee St and Fair Oaks Ave, currently occupied by gas station, a mixed used building with a bridal store, and a restaurant.\r\nWithout investigating further, I’m confident that any of those non-water sites would fail one or more of the other criteria. And even if they didn’t: If your criteria set up that in a city the size of Madison your choices are this narrow, you either didn’t understand the implications of this (no shelter) or you did understand them and wanted to hide your policy goals behind seemingly reasonable criteria.\r\nDid you like this post? Consider making a donation to Urban Triage, a Madison-based organization that provides resources to people experiencing or at risk of homelessness. Or support the Madison Tenant Resource Center.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Last weekend, my SO was reading through the panel descriptions of the Society for the Social Studies of Science’s (4S) annual meeting to figure out which panel to submit an abstract to. There were over 200 panels to choose from, and so this would be a good opportunity to practice some of the techniques I learned.\r\nThe tidytext tutorial works with data sets that are already nice and clean. For the 4S panels we need to do some web scraping and data cleaning first. The web scraping with rvest is also a first for me. The first part of this post will cover the scraping and cleaning. If you want to read about the text analysis, skip ahead to the second part.\r\nScraping the data\r\nAll panels are listed on this page: https://www.4sonline.org/meeting/accepted-open-panels/. We could scrape the panel titles and descriptions right there. Note, however, that the description here is only a snippet, not the full panel description. We’ll deal with this later.\r\nStep one is to load the relevant libraries and read in the html page.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\r\nlibrary(tidytext)\r\nlibrary(rvest)\r\nlibrary(rmarkdown)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\npanel_url <- \"https://www.4sonline.org/meeting/accepted-open-panels\"\r\npanels <- read_html(panel_url)\r\npanels\r\n\r\n\r\n{html_document}\r\n<html lang=\"en-US\">\r\n[1] <head>\\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; cha ...\r\n[2] <body class=\"page-template-default page page-id-12988 page-chil ...\r\n\r\nThe next step is to extract the relevant information from that HTML document. If you have a basic understanding of how HTML and CSS work, you could do this by opening the source code of the page in your browser and manually identify the relevant elements.\r\nScreenshot source codeHere you see that the panel titles are all level 3 headings (<h3>) of the class entry-title. An easier way to identify the element is by using your browser’s element picker. In Firefox, press F12 and choose the element picker. Then choose the element you want to identify and look at the code in the Inspector window. Here’s a screenshot of what this looks like for the panel description:\r\nScreenshot element pickerSo the panel description is a div of the class post-inner-content. (There is a third method to identify relevant content, which we’ll use later).\r\nWith this information, we’re ready to extract panel titles and descriptions:\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\npanel_titles <- panels %>% html_nodes(\".entry-title\") %>% html_text()\r\n\r\npanel_desc <- panels %>% html_nodes(\".post-content-inner\") %>% html_text()\r\n\r\npanels_all <- tibble(title = panel_titles, desc = panel_desc)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA quick bit of data cleaning to remove the numbers from the titles and use them as an ID column instead:\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\npanels_all <- panels_all %>% \r\n  mutate(id = str_extract(title, \"^\\\\d*\"),\r\n         title = str_remove(title, \"^\\\\d+.\\\\s\"))\r\n  \r\npanels_all\r\n\r\n\r\n# A tibble: 210 x 3\r\n   title                          desc                           id   \r\n   <chr>                          <chr>                          <chr>\r\n 1 (Bio)Engineering Nature: Edit~ Since the discovery in 2015 o~ 1    \r\n 2 (Dis)Trust in Public-Sector D~ STS scholarship on technopoli~ 2    \r\n 3 (Im)material streams in the c~ The deepening datafication of~ 3    \r\n 4 (Re)configuring care practice~ Care practices were addressed~ 4    \r\n 5 (Re)materialising Cancer: Bod~ Bioscientific approaches to i~ 5    \r\n 6 A Good Life, In Theory: Think~ In recent years, an increasin~ 6    \r\n 7 Academic Automation, Machine ~ Over the last 70 years, compu~ 7    \r\n 8 Aerotechnologies: Air as Elem~ “Objects, processes, or event~ 8    \r\n 9 Aging with other-than-humans:~ In recent years, Science and ~ 9    \r\n10 AI and Feminist STS            Much excellent work has docum~ 10   \r\n# ... with 200 more rows\r\n\r\nLooks pretty good, doesn’t it? Let’s do a simple analysis: What are the most frequent words in the panel titles (after removing common stop words)?\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\npanels_all %>% \r\n  unnest_tokens(word, title, token = \"words\") %>% \r\n  anti_join(get_stopwords()) %>% \r\n  count(word, sort = T)\r\n\r\n\r\n# A tibble: 723 x 2\r\n   word             n\r\n   <chr>        <int>\r\n 1 sts             29\r\n 2 relations       24\r\n 3 science         23\r\n 4 technologies    15\r\n 5 technology      15\r\n 6 global          14\r\n 7 good            13\r\n 8 governance      13\r\n 9 knowledge       12\r\n10 research        12\r\n# ... with 713 more rows\r\n\r\nUnsurprisingly, STS has the top spot – it’s the acronym for the whole field: Science and Technology Studies. Before diving deeper into the analysis, let’s get the complete descriptions. This requires following the links from the panel titles and scraping those pages. This is a good opportunity to use a third option of identifying elements in an HTML page: Rvest’s Selector Gadget. By loading the bookmarklet on the overview page we can identify the URL elements for scraping. We extract the URLs like so:\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\nurls <- panels %>% \r\n  html_nodes(\"#post-12988 a\") %>% \r\n  html_attr(\"href\") %>% \r\n  tibble()\r\n\r\ntail(urls)\r\n\r\n\r\n# A tibble: 6 x 1\r\n  .                                                                   \r\n  <chr>                                                               \r\n1 https://www.4sonline.org/category/op21/race-and-racism-21/          \r\n2 https://www.4sonline.org/category/op21/science-communication-public~\r\n3 https://www.4sonline.org/category/op21/social-justice-social-moveme~\r\n4 https://www.4sonline.org/category/op21/transnational-sts-21/        \r\n5 https://www.4sonline.org/category/op21/other-21/                    \r\n6 #                                                                   \r\n\r\nThe list of URLs is fairly clean, but there are a few irrelevant URLs that slipped through. We’ll filter them out with a regular expression.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\nurls <- urls %>% \r\n  rename(url = \".\")\r\n\r\n#filter out irrelevant URLs\r\nurls <- urls %>% \r\n  filter(str_detect(url, \"https://www.4sonline.org/\\\\d\")) %>% \r\n  pull(url)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow we can get all pages by using map_df across all URLs and a custom function to extract the relevant information. Let’s develop the function using the first URL. Again using the Selector Gadget, it seems like these should be the relevant elements to extract:\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\npage <- read_html(urls[1])\r\n\r\npage_2 <- page %>% \r\n  html_nodes(\".et_pb_text_inner , .et_pb_post_content_0_tb_body p, .et_pb_module_header\") %>% \r\n  html_text() \r\n\r\n\r\ntibble(\r\n  title = page_2[1],\r\n  organizer = page_2[2],\r\n  posted = page_2[3],\r\n  desc = page_2[4],\r\n  contact = page_2[5],\r\n  keywords = page_2[6]\r\n)\r\n\r\n\r\n# A tibble: 1 x 6\r\n  title       organizer    posted   desc       contact   keywords     \r\n  <chr>       <chr>        <chr>    <chr>      <chr>     <chr>        \r\n1 1. (Bio)En~ Elliott Rei~ \"Posted~ \"Since th~ Contact:~ Keywords: ge~\r\n\r\nNow we can just run the function over the length of the URL vector with map_df. Don’t run this yet, though.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\npages_full <- map_df(1:length(urls), function(i) {\r\n  page <- read_html(urls[i])\r\n\r\npage_2 <- page %>% \r\n  html_nodes(\".et_pb_text_inner , .et_pb_post_content_0_tb_body p, .et_pb_module_header\") %>% \r\n  html_text() \r\n\r\ntibble(\r\n  title = page_2[1],\r\n  organizer = page_2[2],\r\n  posted = page_2[3],\r\n  desc = page_2[4],\r\n  contact = page_2[5],\r\n  keywords = page_2[6]\r\n)\r\n  \r\n}\r\n  )\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you ran the code and took a look at the resulting data frame, you’d see that the code breaks for panels that have multiple <p> paragraphs in the description. There may be a more elegant fix, but for now we change the code for the html_elements to be less specific and not split out individual paragraphs. The downside is that the contact info and keywords get lumped in with the description. We can fix that later.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\npages_full <- map_df(1:length(urls), function(i) {\r\n  page <- read_html(urls[i])\r\n\r\npage_2 <- page %>% \r\n  html_nodes(\".et_pb_post_content_0_tb_body , .et_pb_text_inner, .et_pb_module_header\") %>% \r\n  html_text() \r\n\r\ntibble(\r\n  title = page_2[1],\r\n  organizer = page_2[2],\r\n  posted = page_2[3],\r\n  desc = page_2[4]\r\n)\r\n\r\n  \r\n}\r\n  )\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs scraping 210 pages takes a long time, we’ll save the results as an rds file.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\nwrite_rds(pages_full, paste0(\"data/pages_full_\", Sys.Date(), \".rds\"))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNext we’ll clean the panel data, including fixing the lumped together panel description, contact info, and keywords.

So a panel can be listed in more than one theme. Different types of analysis require different data formats, and so we’ll create two data frames: For the first one, we want to keep one row per panel. This requires a sequence of pivot_wider, unite, and separate on the themes data before doing a join with the panels_full_wide data frame.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\nthemes_full_wide <- themes_full %>% \r\n  pivot_wider(id_cols = c(title, id), names_from = \"theme\", values_from = theme) %>% \r\n  unite(\"theme\", 3:26, sep = \";\", remove = T, na.rm = T) %>% \r\n  separate(theme, into = c(\"theme_1\", \"theme_2\", \"theme_3\"), sep = \";\")\r\n\r\npanels_full_wide <- panels_full_wide %>% \r\n  left_join(themes_full_wide, by = c(\"id\", \"title\"))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the multiple keyword_n, organizer_n, and theme_n columns, the data does not lend itself to an analysis by these variables. For that, we need to pivot the data to a longer format.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\npanels_full_long <- panels_full_wide %>% \r\n  pivot_longer(starts_with(\"organizer_\"), names_prefix = \"organizer_\", names_to = \"organizer_order\", values_to = \"Organizer_name\", values_drop_na = T) %>% \r\n  pivot_longer(starts_with(\"keyword_\"), names_prefix = \"keyword_\", names_to = \"keyword_order\", values_to = \"keyword\", values_drop_na = T) %>% \r\n  pivot_longer(starts_with(\"theme_\"), names_prefix = \"theme_\", names_to = \"theme_order\", values_to = \"theme\", values_drop_na = T)\r\n\r\nglimpse(panels_full_long)\r\n\r\n\r\nRows: 6,305\r\nColumns: 10\r\n$ title           <chr> \"(Bio)Engineering Nature: Editing environmen~\r\n$ posted          <chr> \"Posted: January 27, 2021\\n\", \"Posted: Janua~\r\n$ desc            <chr> \"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSince the dis~\r\n$ id              <chr> \"1\", \"1\", \"1\", \"1\", \"1\", \"1\", \"1\", \"1\", \"1\",~\r\n$ organizer_order <chr> \"1\", \"1\", \"1\", \"1\", \"1\", \"1\", \"1\", \"1\", \"1\",~\r\n$ Organizer_name  <chr> \"Elliott Reichardt, Stanford University\", \"E~\r\n$ keyword_order   <chr> \"1\", \"1\", \"1\", \"2\", \"2\", \"2\", \"3\", \"3\", \"3\",~\r\n$ keyword         <chr> \"gene drives\", \"gene drives\", \"gene drives\",~\r\n$ theme_order     <chr> \"1\", \"2\", \"3\", \"1\", \"2\", \"3\", \"1\", \"2\", \"3\",~\r\n$ theme           <chr> \"Environmental/Multispecies Studies\", \"Genet~\r\n\r\nThat’s it for data prep!

The filtered analysis has fewer irrelevant trigrams such as “in order to” or “as well as,” but it also filters out meaningful phrases like “the global south” that otherwise would feature prominently.\r\nTerm frequency–inverse document frequency\r\nGoing further than just counting words and ngrams, we can look at their relevance in comparison to the whole of all panel descriptions. This addresses the issue that terms like “science and technology” or “this open panel” are going to feature in a large number of panel descriptions and therefore don’t add a lot of information. To do this, we look at the term frequency–inverse document frequency (tf-idf), “a numerical statistic that is intended to reflect how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus.”(“Tfidf” 2021) The tidytext package has the convenient bind_tf_idf() function for this:\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\npanels_full_wide %>% \r\n  unnest_tokens(word, desc, token = \"words\") %>% \r\n  count(word, id) %>% \r\n  bind_tf_idf(word, id, n) %>%\r\n  left_join(panels_full_wide, by = \"id\") %>% \r\n  select(word, n, tf_idf, title) %>% \r\n  arrange(-tf_idf) %>% \r\n  head(500) %>% \r\n  paged_table()\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe can do the same analysis but group the panels by theme to identify distinctive trigrams for each of the themes. This is where the long format of the panel data is needed.

    "contents": "\r\nI’m a heavy user of the tidycensus package, and just yesterday I learned that its development version has a great new feature: You can now retrieve migration flows for counties and metro areas! Of course I needed to test this out, looking at Madison (or to be precise: Dane County). Our city and region have been steadily growing, and so where have people been moving from? And where do the people go who leave? It now only takes a few lines of code to find out.\r\n\r\nNote that you need the install the Github version of tidycensus for this to work. To do so, use remotes::install_github(\"https://github.com/walkerke/tidycensus/\").\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\nlibrary(tidycensus)\r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\r\nlibrary(mapdeck)\r\ndane_flows <- get_flows(\r\n  geography = \"county\",\r\n  state = \"WI\",\r\n  county = \"Dane\",\r\n  year = 2018, #this is the latest data available currently\r\n  geometry = TRUE\r\n  )\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere people are moving from\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\ntop_move_in_table <- dane_flows %>% \r\n  filter(variable == \"MOVEDIN\") %>% \r\n  slice_max(n = 25, order_by = estimate) %>% \r\n  mutate(\r\n    width = estimate / 400,\r\n    tooltip = paste0(\r\n      scales::comma(estimate * 5, 1),\r\n      \" people moved from \", FULL2_NAME,\r\n      \" to \", FULL1_NAME, \" between 2014 and 2018\"\r\n      )\r\n    )\r\nrmarkdown::paged_table(top_move_in_table %>% select(FULL2_NAME, estimate))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe top county for in-migration is actually a continent: Asia. And another continent, Europe, also makes the top-10. Most of the counties people are coming from are in-state, and probably a good portion is students moving to attend UW-Madison. Cook County – in other words: Chicago – takes first spot for out-of-state mover, and Hennepin County (Minneapolis) follows closely. Farther away, there is Hamilton County in Ohio (Cincinatti), Middlesex County in Massachussetts, just outside Boston, and one West Coast county: San Diego, California.\r\nWe can map these flows, but for non-US origins/destinations, no geometry is provided. If we wanted to map these, we’d manually have to add these. For this article, we’ll filter them out.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\ntop_move_in_table %>% \r\n  filter(!is.na(GEOID2)) %>% \r\n  mapdeck(style = mapdeck_style(\"light\"), pitch = 45) %>% \r\n  add_arc(\r\n    origin = \"centroid1\",\r\n    destination = \"centroid2\",\r\n    stroke_width = \"width\",\r\n    auto_highlight = TRUE,\r\n    highlight_colour = \"#8c43facc\",\r\n    tooltip = \"tooltip\"\r\n  ) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere people are moving to\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\ntop_move_out_table <- dane_flows %>% \r\n  filter(variable == \"MOVEDOUT\") %>% \r\n  slice_max(n = 25, order_by = estimate) %>% \r\n  mutate(\r\n    width = estimate / 400,\r\n    tooltip = paste0(\r\n      scales::comma(estimate * 5, 1),\r\n      \" people moved from \", FULL1_NAME,\r\n      \" to \", FULL2_NAME, \" between 2014 and 2018\"\r\n      )\r\n    )\r\n\r\nrmarkdown::paged_table(top_move_out_table %>% select(FULL2_NAME, estimate))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne limitation of the data is that for out-migration (and consequently net migration), there is no data for people leaving the US – someone who has moved to South America won’t receive an American Community Survey. With that in mind, destinations are spread more widely. The West Coast draws heavily with Seattle, the Bay Area, Los Angeles, and San Diego. Austin (Texas), and of course New York City, and the head scratcher of Harrisburg (Pennsylvania). Closer by, the same places that show up for in-migration also feature here: Minneapolis, Chicago, Milwaukee, and various counties across Wisconsin.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\ntop_move_out_table %>% \r\n  filter(!is.na(GEOID2)) %>% \r\n  mapdeck(style = mapdeck_style(\"light\"), pitch = 45) %>% \r\n  add_arc(\r\n    origin = \"centroid1\",\r\n    destination = \"centroid2\",\r\n    stroke_width = \"width\",\r\n    auto_highlight = TRUE,\r\n    highlight_colour = \"#8c43facc\",\r\n    tooltip = \"tooltip\"\r\n  ) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNet migration\r\nThe data also include a variable for net migration, MOVEDNET.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\ntop_move_net_table <- dane_flows %>% \r\n  filter(variable == \"MOVEDNET\") %>% \r\n  slice_max(n = 25, order_by = estimate) %>% \r\n  mutate(\r\n    width = estimate / 400,\r\n    tooltip = paste0(\r\n      scales::comma(estimate * 5, 1),\r\n      \" more people moved from \", FULL2_NAME,\r\n      \" to \", FULL1_NAME, \" between 2014 and 2018 than in the reverse direction\"\r\n      )\r\n    )\r\nrmarkdown::paged_table(top_move_net_table %>% select(FULL2_NAME, estimate))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe numbers here are smaller, but you can see that Waukesha, which was at the top of the total in-migration list also tops the net migration. That is, 1445 more people moved from Waukesha to Dane County than in the other direction. Overall, the numbers here are much smaller, and the maps looks a little different again.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\ntop_move_net_table %>% \r\n  filter(!is.na(GEOID2)) %>% \r\n  mapdeck(style = mapdeck_style(\"light\"), pitch = 45) %>% \r\n  add_arc(\r\n    origin = \"centroid1\",\r\n    destination = \"centroid2\",\r\n    stroke_width = \"width\",\r\n    auto_highlight = TRUE,\r\n    highlight_colour = \"#8c43facc\",\r\n    tooltip = \"tooltip\"\r\n  ) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAge groups\r\nThe UW-Madison is probably a big driver of migration in Dane County, and we can look at this by grouping in-migration by age group.\r\n\r\nNote that this is 2011–2015 data, not the 2014–2018 data used in the rest of the article.\r\n\r\n\r\nShow code\r\n\r\nage_flows <- get_flows(\r\n  geography = \"county\",\r\n  county = \"Dane\",\r\n  state = \"WI\",\r\n  breakdown = \"AGE\",\r\n  breakdown_labels = TRUE,\r\n  year = 2015\r\n  )\r\n\r\n\r\nage_flows %>% \r\n  filter(variable == \"MOVEDIN\", AGE_label != \"All ages\") %>% \r\n  group_by(AGE_label, FULL2_NAME) %>% \r\n  summarize(estimate) %>% \r\n  slice_max(n = 5, order_by = estimate) %>% \r\n  arrange(AGE_label,-estimate) %>% \r\n  DT::datatable(rownames = FALSE)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThese are the top-5 origins for each age group. If you sort by the estimate column, you see the largest in-migrant group are 20–24 year-olds from Asia, and overall the top groups are indeed heavily undergraduate- and graduate-student aged. Electronic health record company Epic, one of the largest employers in the country, is probably driving some of these numbers as wel. Sort by AGE_label to see the top origins for each age group.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "contents": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn previous posts I have worked with data from the US Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS). ACS is great for data on people and households. For employment data, however, there is a better (or maybe complementary) source: The LEHD Origin-Destination Employment Statistics (LODES). The data can be accessed via a somewhat clunky web interface, On the Map or downloaded and then analyzed in your software of choice. One unique feature of LODES is the “OD” part in its name: It provides the number of people who commute from one census block to another. This can be helpful in transportation or general urban planning. For example, are there major employment centers that have a large share of its workers living in the same part of town, and could they therefore easily be served by transit?\r\nIn this post I will look at LODES data for Madison and the state of Wisconsin as a whole. The latest LODES data available is from 2018.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nData preparation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe file structure is explained here, page 6. There are two geography identifier variables, w_geocode and h_geocode, and a number of variables for the number of jobs for that geography pair. S000 is the one for total jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mapdeck arc visualization requires either two pairs of coordinates or sfc columns.\r\nI will get TIGER geographies with the tigris package, calculate centroids with sf, and then merge with the LODES data. Note that LODES uses the 2010 vintage for its geographies, whereas tigris defaults to the most recent vintage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLet’s look at the distribution of the number of jobs per origin-destination pair:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis does not look terribly promising–maybe block pairs are the wrong unit of analysis, with a huge number of them only having a single job-home pair. Aggregation to block groups or tracts may make more sense, but for now I’ll proceed with the blocks.\r\nCommute flows in Wisconsin\r\nThe number of block pairs is large, and so I’ll sample the 100 blocks with the largest number of commutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow we can do a double join with the block centroids: First, join on the work geocode, then do another join on the home geocode. This will create a new dataframe with two geometry columns. In order to work with the mapdeck package, the dataframe needs to be turned into an sf object. Finally, we add a thickness helper variable based on the number of jobs in the OD pair. This variable will specify the width of the arcs in the visualization.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCensus blocks can be oddly shaped, and so it’s a good idea to plot the actual blocks and not just their centroids.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVisualizing the flows\r\nNow we can visualize the top-100 commute flows in the state:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWow, it is immediately obvious how dominant commute flows in the Madison area are! And by zooming in you can identify some other patterns:\r\nIn Madison two employers capture almost all commute flows: The UW-Madison downtown1 and electronic health record company Epic in suburban Verona. The only other employer making an appearance is the university hospital (which is a separate entity from the university)\r\nIn Milwaukee, by far the state’s largest city, there are only three OD pairs in total: Two point at the 32-story Northwestern Mutual Tower downtown; the third leads to the large suburban medical campus that includes the Medical College of Wisconsin, Froedtert Hospital, and the Childrens’ Hospital of Wisconsin.\r\nSheboygan is probably best known for plumbing product company Kohler, and the Kohler Co. headquarters make a prominent appearance on the map, with 8 arcs pointing at it.\r\nFor the remainder of OD pairs around the state, it’s primarily meat processing, healthcare facilities, and tribal facilities that appear as destinations.\r\nFor two OD pairs, home and work are actually in the same block: One is the UW in Platteville (presumably students living and working on campus), and a strangely empty looking wooded block near Hayward. My best guess is that it’s a farm or forestry business.\r\nMadison flows\r\nGiven the visual prominence of Madison on the map (and my personal interest in Madison), it makes sense to do a separate analysis just for flows within Dane County.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWell, this doesn’t look all that different, does it? More arcs, but all of them still point at the UW, Epic, and the university hospital. This doesn’t change even if you look at the top-150 OD pairs. Only once you bump it up to 300, a few more work locations appear.\r\n\r\n[1] \"550250011021004\" \"550250108003008\" \"550250032001008\"\r\n[4] \"550250114022021\" \"550250114022035\" \"550250017042003\"\r\n\r\nPlotting 300 arcs of course is a bit of a mess:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you scroll around enough you see the City-County Building, American Family Insurance, and a block with several employers near the Am Fam campus.\r\nAmerican Family Insurance and some other employment at the nothern edge of townSome observations:\r\nThere are about 20 contiguous blocks in the Bassett and Mifflin neighborhood that have a lot of people commuting to Epic. That area is well served by the 75 bus providing peak-hour service to and from Epic in 35 to 40 minutes\r\nThere are surprisingly few commute blocks on the east side. For Epic employees that makes sense, as traveling through the isthmus takes a good amount of time, but I would have expected more prominent UW flows\r\nThe “Epic blocks” downtownAggregating to block groups\r\nI mentioned at the beginning of the article that census blocks tend to be fairly small. What happens when we aggregate them into block groups?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the cut-off set to the 100 most frequent OD pairs, a few additional employment centers make an appearance, along the Beltline in Middleton. Other than that, there is not much insight to be gained. And especially along the edges of town, the block groups are quite large. If, for example, your goal is transit planning, using blocks is probably the better choice.\r\nConclusion\r\nThis is my first time extensively working with LODES origin-destination data and I have learned a lot in terms of data prep and visualization. In terms of actual insights, I am a bit disappointed. Everything being so centered on the UW and Epic leaves little opportunity to learn about other employment centers. But maybe the realization just how dominant these employers are in terms of commute flows is a valuable insight in itself. How, for example, could all those Epic employees on the west side of Madison and in Middleton be better served by transit? And why do Epic employees seemingly cluster more in where they live? The trope of “Epic luxury apartments” downtown is well known—and appears to have some truth to it.\r\n\r\nFor some reason, the university reports all(?) of its employees as working at a single location. In reality, UW employment is more spread out.↩︎\r\n",

    "contents": "\r\nHow do people get to work and back in Madison? And how does this differ for people of different economic status and racial and ethnic backgrounds? I had some idea about what this looked like at the national level, but I was always curious what the numbers would be for Madison. I have previously written about commute mode share in Madison over time, based on data from the American Community Survey (ACS). The ACS does have detailed information on race, ethnicity, and income, but what is publicly available on the ACS website doesn’t lend itself to this type of analysis. Fortunately, there is another data source: CTPP. This stands for Census Transportation Planning Products, “a State DOT-funded, cooperative program that produces special tabulations of American Community Survey (ACS) data that have enhanced value for transportation planning, analysis, and strategic direction.” So same data source, but organized in a different way. And the latest data available is for 2012–2016.\r\n\r\nI recommend reading my other article on bike mode share in Madison to get a sense of the limitations of ACS data. It only captures commute trips, and the margins of error can be sizable.\r\nCommuting and minority status\r\nThe way CTPP treats race and ethnicity is by putting people into two categories: White people who aren’t Latinx/Hispanic, and everyone else. There are all kinds of issues with splitting things up this way, but using a more fine-grained approach to race and ethnicity would lead to small groups in each category and less reliable data.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the same data but in a table.\r\n\r\n\r\nCommute mode\r\n\r\n\r\nNon-Hispanic White\r\n\r\n\r\nRacial/ethnic minority\r\n\r\n\r\nTotal\r\n\r\n\r\nDifference\r\n\r\n\r\nDrove alone\r\n\r\n\r\n65.3%\r\n\r\n\r\n55.8%\r\n\r\n\r\n63.4%\r\n\r\n\r\n9.5%\r\n\r\n\r\nBus\r\n\r\n\r\n7.7%\r\n\r\n\r\n15.4%\r\n\r\n\r\n9.3%\r\n\r\n\r\n-7.7%\r\n\r\n\r\nCarpooled\r\n\r\n\r\n6.5%\r\n\r\n\r\n11.7%\r\n\r\n\r\n7.6%\r\n\r\n\r\n-5.1%\r\n\r\n\r\nBiked\r\n\r\n\r\n5.7%\r\n\r\n\r\n3.1%\r\n\r\n\r\n5.2%\r\n\r\n\r\n2.6%\r\n\r\n\r\nWorked at home\r\n\r\n\r\n4.6%\r\n\r\n\r\n2.4%\r\n\r\n\r\n4.1%\r\n\r\n\r\n2.2%\r\n\r\n\r\nWalked\r\n\r\n\r\n9.3%\r\n\r\n\r\n10.3%\r\n\r\n\r\n9.5%\r\n\r\n\r\n-1.0%\r\n\r\n\r\nother\r\n\r\n\r\n0.8%\r\n\r\n\r\n1.4%\r\n\r\n\r\n1.0%\r\n\r\n\r\n-0.5%\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rightmost column shows the difference in percentage points between the two population groups (i.e. the distance between the two dots on the previous plot). That difference is largest for driving to work alone: The rate of driving alone is almost 10 percentage points higher for non-Hispanic White commuters. Depending on what question we’re trying to answer, it may be more useful to put this difference in the context of overall commute rates. Yes, there is a large difference in driving alone rates, but it also the overall most common commute mode. Compare that to bus commuters: The rate of bus commuting for people belonging to a racial or ethnic minority is twice as high as that for non-Hispanic White commuters, 15.4% versus 7.7%. With the difference in the reverse direction, the rate of bike commuters and people working from home is close to twice as high for non-Hispanic White workers. The only mode where rates are more or less the same for both groups is walking to work, at around 10 percent.\r\nIncome\r\nA different way to look at commute mode is by household income. Of course, income and race/ethnicity are not independent of each other. But especially with the coarse distinction between non-Hispanic White versus everyone else, looking at income can bring additional insights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor most commute modes, there is a clear trend across income groups: The more you make, the more likely you are to drive alone, and the less likely you are to walk or take the bus to work. It’s a little more complicated for other modes:\r\nBiking is most common for people in low-income households and then drops for with increasing income. However, at the top of the scale, in households with an income over $150,000, the trend reverses and more people bike to work.\r\nThe inverse is true for working from home: The rate is highest at the highest incomes and then drops with lower income. But for people in households making less than $15,000, it goes up again.\r\nFinally, for carpooling there doesn’t seem to be a clear trend. Between $15,000 and $100,000 household income, the rates are more or less the same. Very low income household don’t carpool much; and for some reason, incomes between $125,000 and $150,000 have the highest rate of carpooling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "contents": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI got some good feedback after posting my article on Madison’s zoning restrictions on Facebook and Reddit, prompting some additional analyses.\r\nWhy do you look only at residentially zoned land?\r\nSeveral people pointed out that comparing the zoning districts that only allow detached single-family homes (SFR) to all residential zoning districts may be misleading. In many cities the densest parts are not in residential zoning districts but in downtown areas zoned for mixed use. I think that’s a fair point, but it was the original NYT article that chose only residential areas as the comparator, and I wanted to make Madison comparable to the other cities in the NYT analysis.\r\nNonetheless, I quickly ran the analysis comparing SFR to any district except “special districts.” These includes parks, conservancies, agricultural land, airports, or the UW-Campus—in other words districts that are highly unlikely to ever have residential use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#detached single-family only\r\nres_sfr <- data %>%\r\n  filter(ZONING_CODE %in% sfr_zones) %>%\r\n  summarize(sum(ShapeSTArea))\r\n# only special district area\r\nother_area <- data %>%\r\n  filter(ZONING_CODE %in% other) %>%\r\n  summarise(sum(ShapeSTArea))\r\ntotal <- data %>% summarize(sum(ShapeSTArea))\r\nres_sfr/(total-other_area)\r\n\r\n\r\n  sum(ShapeSTArea)\r\n1        0.4873358\r\n\r\nThe result? 49% of all land that reasonably could have residential units on it allows only single-family attached housing. Since there is no point of comparison to other cities, it’s hard to interpret that number.\r\nIs there a correlation between the percentage of SFR zoning and overall density?\r\nIt’s a good question: Does the metric the NYT used actually have an association with overall density of a city? (Note that even if there is a correlation, this absolutely doesn’t mean there is a causal connection! There are many, many factors that impact a city’s overall density.)\r\nThere are few data points to work with. I retrieved density information for all cities in the NYT article and Madison from Wikipedia:\r\n\r\n\r\nCity\r\n\r\n\r\nDensity (pop./sq.mi.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSingle-family (%)\r\n\r\n\r\nNew York\r\n\r\n\r\n27751\r\n\r\n\r\n15\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington\r\n\r\n\r\n11367\r\n\r\n\r\n36\r\n\r\n\r\nSeattle\r\n\r\n\r\n8642\r\n\r\n\r\n81\r\n\r\n\r\nLos Angeles\r\n\r\n\r\n8483\r\n\r\n\r\n75\r\n\r\n\r\nMinneapolis\r\n\r\n\r\n7821\r\n\r\n\r\n70\r\n\r\n\r\nSan Jose (CA)\r\n\r\n\r\n5776\r\n\r\n\r\n94\r\n\r\n\r\nPortland (OR)\r\n\r\n\r\n4504\r\n\r\n\r\n77\r\n\r\n\r\nArlington (TX)\r\n\r\n\r\n3810\r\n\r\n\r\n89\r\n\r\n\r\nMadison\r\n\r\n\r\n3233\r\n\r\n\r\n75\r\n\r\n\r\nSandy Springs (GA)\r\n\r\n\r\n2707\r\n\r\n\r\n85\r\n\r\n\r\nCharlotte (NC)\r\n\r\n\r\n2400\r\n\r\n\r\n84\r\n\r\n\r\nLet’s see what the overall correlation is:\r\n\r\n# A tibble: 1 x 1\r\n  `cor(density, sfr)`\r\n                <dbl>\r\n1              -0.885\r\n\r\nHm, -0.89. That’s a very, very high correlation. But it’s always good to look at your data points in a scatterplot to see what’s actually going on:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOkay, New York is clearly way out there. Let’s exclude NYC and do the correlation again:\r\n\r\n\r\n dens_zon %>% \r\n   spread(Measure, Value) %>%\r\n   filter(City != \"New York\") %>%\r\n   summarize(cor(density, sfr))\r\n\r\n\r\n# A tibble: 1 x 1\r\n  `cor(density, sfr)`\r\n                <dbl>\r\n1              -0.693\r\n\r\nThat gets us a correlation of -0.69. Much lower, but still pretty high. Is DC also an outlier?\r\n\r\n\r\n dens_zon %>% \r\n   spread(Measure, Value) %>%\r\n   filter(City != \"New York\" & City != \"Washington\") %>%\r\n   summarize(cor(density, sfr))\r\n\r\n\r\n# A tibble: 1 x 1\r\n  `cor(density, sfr)`\r\n                <dbl>\r\n1              -0.366\r\n\r\nThis lower the correlation to -0.37. That is, there is a small negative association between how dense a city is and how much of its residential land is zoned exclusively for detached single-family homes. But more data is needed to confirm this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
